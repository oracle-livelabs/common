## Task 1: title

Step 1 opening paragraph.

1. Sub step 1

  To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use this format:

  Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

  *Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)*

2. Sub step 2 with image and link to the text description below. The `sample1.txt` file must be added to the `files` folder.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png "Image title")

3. Ordered list item 3 with the same image but no link to the text description below.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png " ")

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. One example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## Task 2: title

1. Sub step 1

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in &lt;copy&gt;&lt;/copy&gt;.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

  To include `<` and `>` in your code fragments, use ``&lt;`` and ``&gt;`` to escape the characters in the code block:

	```
  <copy>ssh -i &lt;ssh-key-file&gt;</copy>
  ```

*At the conclusion of the lab add this statement:*
You may proceed to the next lab.
