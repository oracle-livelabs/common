## Oracle Version Notes (19c vs 26ai)

The OCR detail page presents this repository as a tool image with versioned exporter tags, not as a 19c-versus-26ai database image line. Use the OCR tags table to select the exporter release you need.

## When to Use / When Not to Use

- **Use this image when:** Use when you need DB metrics/logs/traces export into observability stacks.
- **Use another image when:** Avoid when you need a database server image; this is tooling/exporter only.
- **Cross-image decision aid:** `skills/containers/container-selection-matrix.md`
