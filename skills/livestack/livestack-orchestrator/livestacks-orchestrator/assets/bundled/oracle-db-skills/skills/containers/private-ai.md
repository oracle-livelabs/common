# `private-ai` OCR Repository

## Overview

`database/private-ai` is the Oracle Container Registry repository for Oracle Private AI Services Container. Oracle lists this repository in the OCR Database business area and publishes both a latest pull command and a tags table for selecting concrete image versions.

## Repository Snapshot

- **Registry path:** `container-registry.oracle.com/database/private-ai`
- **OCR short description:** Oracle Private AI Services Container
- **Latest pull command shown on OCR:** `docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/private-ai:latest`
- **License note on OCR:** OCR presents this as a standard Oracle repository. The detail page prompts you to sign in with an Oracle account to accept the repository license agreement before downloading the image.

## What Oracle Documents Here

- The OCR readme documents both non-secure HTTP mode and secure HTTPS-plus-authentication mode for the Private AI Services container.
- The page says that, as of version `25.1.2.0.0`, the image includes scripts that simplify secure and non-secure setup and can be copied out of the image for guided configuration.
- OCR also says that `25.x.x.x.x` versions of the service support ONNX embedding pipeline models only, and points to OML4Py guidance for model conversion.

## Oracle Version Notes (19c vs 26ai)

The OCR detail page explicitly calls out 25.x image behavior. In particular, it notes setup scripts starting with `25.1.2.0.0` and states that the 25.x service supports ONNX embedding pipeline models only.

## When to Use / When Not to Use

- **Use this image when:** Use when deploying Oracle Private AI Services container endpoints.
- **Use another image when:** Avoid when you only need a base database runtime without AI service APIs.
- **Cross-image decision aid:** `skills/containers/container-selection-matrix.md`
