# `cman` OCR Repository

## Overview

`database/cman` is the Oracle Container Registry repository for Oracle Connection Manager. Oracle lists this repository in the OCR Database business area and publishes both a latest pull command and a tags table for selecting concrete image versions.

## Repository Snapshot

- **Registry path:** `container-registry.oracle.com/database/cman`
- **OCR short description:** Oracle Connection Manager

- **License note on OCR:** OCR presents this as a standard Oracle repository. The detail page prompts you to sign in with an Oracle account to accept the repository license agreement before downloading the image.

## What Oracle Documents Here

- The OCR readme positions this image as Oracle Connection Manager in Linux containers for proxying and managing client database connections.
- The page says you can use the container with Oracle RAC or a single-instance Oracle Database, as long as the SCAN name or database hostname is resolvable from the container.
- The OCR readme examples currently use `container-registry.oracle.com/database/client-cman:latest`, while the repository pull-command section is published under `container-registry.oracle.com/database/cman:latest`.

## Oracle Version Notes (19c vs 26ai)

The OCR detail page does not publish a dedicated 19c-versus-26ai compatibility matrix for `cman`. Use the OCR tags table on the repository page to choose the image version you need.

## When to Use / When Not to Use
