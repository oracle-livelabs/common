# Online Operations in Oracle DB

## Overview

In production Oracle environments, DDL changes have historically required downtime: locking tables, blocking DML, and preventing reads during structural modifications. Oracle provides a suite of online operation features that allow the database to continue serving application traffic while structural changes take place in the background. Understanding these features — and their limitations — is essential for zero-downtime deployments.

The key mechanisms are:

- **DBMS_REDEFINITION** — online restructuring of tables with complex changes (column reordering, type changes, partitioning)
- **Online index operations** — creating or rebuilding indexes without blocking DML
- **ALTER TABLE ... ONLINE** — adding columns, modifying constraints with reduced locking
- **Online segment shrink** — reclaiming space without taking tables offline

These are not universally applicable — each has prerequisites, limitations, and edge cases. This guide explains when and how to use each, with practical examples.

## DBMS_REDEFINITION

### What It Does

`DBMS_REDEFINITION` allows you to restructure a table while it remains fully available for DML. The process works by:

1. Creating an interim table with the new structure.
2. Starting synchronization — Oracle tracks DML applied to the original table in a materialized view log.
3. Copying existing rows to the interim table in the background.
4. Periodically synchronizing incremental changes.
5. Finishing the redefinition — Oracle swaps the table names atomically and drops the original.

Applications see no interruption. The final swap takes a brief exclusive lock (typically milliseconds), but no extended downtime.

### When to Use DBMS_REDEFINITION

Use it when you need to:

- Change column data types (e.g., `VARCHAR2(100)` to `VARCHAR2(500)`, or `DATE` to `TIMESTAMP`)
- Reorder columns (for compression efficiency or application compatibility)
- Convert a heap-organized table to a partitioned table
- Add or remove compression
- Move a table to a different tablespace online
- Significantly change the logical structure that `ALTER TABLE` cannot handle

### Prerequisites

```sql
-- The table must have a primary key (or a unique key you specify as the key_column_list)
-- The schema owner needs EXECUTE on DBMS_REDEFINITION
-- The process requires roughly 1x the table size in additional storage during the operation

-- Verify the table can be redefined
BEGIN
  DBMS_REDEFINITION.CAN_REDEF_TABLE(
    uname        => 'APP_OWNER',
    tname        => 'ORDERS',
    options_flag => DBMS_REDEFINITION.CONS_USE_PK  -- or CONS_USE_ROWID
  );
END;
/
-- If no exception is raised, the table is eligible
```

### Full Example: Converting Heap Table to Range-Partitioned

```sql
-- Step 1: Create the interim table with the new structure
-- The column names and types must be compatible with the original
-- Additional columns in the interim table will start as NULL

CREATE TABLE ORDERS_NEW (
    ORDER_ID     NUMBER(18,0)  NOT NULL,
    CUSTOMER_ID  NUMBER(18,0)  NOT NULL,
    ORDER_DATE   DATE          NOT NULL,
    STATUS_CODE  VARCHAR2(10)  NOT NULL,
    TOTAL_AMOUNT NUMBER(12,4),
    CREATED_AT   TIMESTAMP     DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT PK_ORDERS_NEW PRIMARY KEY (ORDER_ID, ORDER_DATE)
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (ORDER_DATE)
INTERVAL (NUMTOYMINTERVAL(1, 'MONTH'))
(
  PARTITION P_BEFORE_2024 VALUES LESS THAN (DATE '2024-01-01')
    TABLESPACE DATA_TS
);
```

```sql
-- Step 2: Start the redefinition
-- This creates the materialized view log on ORDERS and begins the copy
BEGIN
  DBMS_REDEFINITION.START_REDEF_TABLE(
    uname        => 'APP_OWNER',
    orig_table   => 'ORDERS',
    int_table    => 'ORDERS_NEW',
    col_mapping  => 'ORDER_ID ORDER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID CUSTOMER_ID, ' ||
                    'ORDER_DATE ORDER_DATE, STATUS_CODE STATUS_CODE, ' ||
                    'TOTAL_AMOUNT TOTAL_AMOUNT, SYSTIMESTAMP CREATED_AT',
    options_flag => DBMS_REDEFINITION.CONS_USE_PK
  );
END;
/
```

```sql
-- Step 3: Synchronize incrementally (run one or more times during the copy)
-- This applies DML that occurred since the last sync, reducing final cutover time
BEGIN
  DBMS_REDEFINITION.SYNC_INTERIM_TABLE(
    uname      => 'APP_OWNER',
    orig_table => 'ORDERS',
    int_table  => 'ORDERS_NEW'
  );
END;
/
```

```sql
-- Step 4: Copy dependent objects to the interim table
-- Constraints, indexes, triggers, grants on the interim table become
-- the constraints/indexes/triggers/grants of the final table after swap
DECLARE
  v_num_errors PLS_INTEGER;
BEGIN
  DBMS_REDEFINITION.COPY_TABLE_DEPENDENTS(
    uname            => 'APP_OWNER',
    orig_table       => 'ORDERS',
    int_table        => 'ORDERS_NEW',
    copy_indexes     => DBMS_REDEFINITION.CONS_ORIG_PARAMS,
    copy_triggers    => TRUE,
    copy_constraints => TRUE,
    copy_privileges  => TRUE,
    ignore_errors    => FALSE,
    num_errors       => v_num_errors
  );
  IF v_num_errors > 0 THEN
    RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'COPY_TABLE_DEPENDENTS had errors: ' || v_num_errors);
  END IF;
END;
/
```

```sql
-- Step 5: Final synchronization and atomic swap
-- The original ORDERS table is renamed to ORDERS_OLD (or dropped)
-- ORDERS_NEW becomes ORDERS
BEGIN
  DBMS_REDEFINITION.FINISH_REDEF_TABLE(
    uname        => 'APP_OWNER',
    orig_table   => 'ORDERS',
    int_table    => 'ORDERS_NEW'
  );
END;
/
```

```sql
-- Step 6: Cleanup
-- After verifying the new table is correct, drop the old interim
-- (Oracle renamed ORDERS_NEW to ORDERS and ORDERS to ORDERS_NEW)
DROP TABLE ORDERS_NEW PURGE;
```

### Error Recovery

If the redefinition needs to be aborted at any point:

```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_REDEFINITION.ABORT_REDEF_TABLE(
    uname      => 'APP_OWNER',
    orig_table => 'ORDERS',
    int_table  => 'ORDERS_NEW'
  );
END;
/

-- Then drop the interim table
DROP TABLE ORDERS_NEW PURGE;
```

### Monitoring Progress

```sql
-- Monitor the background copy via MV log and long operations
SELECT
    SID,
    SERIAL#,
    OPNAME,
    SOFAR,
    TOTALWORK,
    ROUND(SOFAR / NULLIF(TOTALWORK, 0) * 100, 1) AS PCT_COMPLETE,
    TIME_REMAINING                                AS SECS_REMAINING
FROM
    V$SESSION_LONGOPS
WHERE
    OPNAME LIKE '%redefinition%'
    OR OPNAME LIKE '%Table Redefinition%';
```

## Online Index Rebuild

### Why Rebuild Indexes?

Indexes accumulate structural inefficiency over time: deleted entries leave empty leaf blocks, heavy DML on monotonically increasing keys creates right-side imbalance (index blowout), and data movement during updates causes clustering factor degradation. Rebuilding corrects these issues without taking the table offline.

### REBUILD ONLINE vs REBUILD

```sql
-- Offline rebuild: table DML is blocked during rebuild
ALTER INDEX IDX_ORDERS_CUSTOMER REBUILD;

-- Online rebuild: DML continues, uses a journal table to track changes
-- Takes longer, more I/O, but does not block application
ALTER INDEX IDX_ORDERS_CUSTOMER REBUILD ONLINE;
```

```sql
-- Rebuild with specific storage options
ALTER INDEX IDX_ORDERS_CUSTOMER
REBUILD ONLINE
TABLESPACE IDX_TS
PARALLEL 4
COMPUTE STATISTICS;
```

```sql
-- Rebuild a partition of a partitioned index
ALTER INDEX IDX_ORDERS_DATE
REBUILD PARTITION P_2024_Q1 ONLINE;
```

### Monitoring Index Health Before Deciding to Rebuild

```sql
-- Analyze index structure
ANALYZE INDEX IDX_ORDERS_CUSTOMER VALIDATE STRUCTURE;

SELECT
    NAME,
    HEIGHT,
    BLOCKS,
    LF_ROWS,
    LF_BLKS,
    LF_ROWS_LEN,
    DEL_LF_ROWS,
    DEL_LF_ROWS_LEN,
    ROUND(DEL_LF_ROWS / NULLIF(LF_ROWS, 0) * 100, 2) AS PCT_DELETED
FROM
    INDEX_STATS;
-- If PCT_DELETED > 20% or HEIGHT > 4 for a B-tree, consider rebuilding
```

```sql
-- Coalesce (cheaper than rebuild — merges leaf blocks without sorting)
-- Does not reduce height, does not move to new tablespace
ALTER INDEX IDX_ORDERS_CUSTOMER COALESCE;
```

---

## Online Index Creation

Creating an index online allows DML to continue on the table during index build. This is the standard approach for adding new indexes to large production tables.

```sql
-- Standard online index creation
CREATE INDEX IDX_ORDERS_STATUS
    ON ORDERS (STATUS_CODE, ORDER_DATE)
    ONLINE
    TABLESPACE IDX_TS
    PARALLEL 4
    COMPUTE STATISTICS
    NOLOGGING;   -- Reduces redo generation; requires full backup after creation

-- After creation, reset to logging for ongoing maintenance
ALTER INDEX IDX_ORDERS_STATUS LOGGING;
```

```sql
-- Unique index online creation
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IDX_ORDERS_REF_NUM
    ON ORDERS (REFERENCE_NUMBER)
    ONLINE
    TABLESPACE IDX_TS;
```

```sql
-- Function-based index online
CREATE INDEX IDX_CUST_EMAIL_UPPER
    ON CUSTOMERS (UPPER(EMAIL))
    ONLINE
    TABLESPACE IDX_TS;
```

### Online Index Limitations

- **Bitmap indexes cannot be created or rebuilt online.** Bitmap indexes are not suitable for OLTP tables with concurrent DML anyway (they lock at the bitmap segment level).
- **Index on IOT (Index-Organized Table)** secondary indexes cannot always be rebuilt online.
- **Unusable partitioned index partitions** must be rebuilt offline if the partition is `UNUSABLE`.
- Online operations consume more undo and temporary space than offline equivalents.

## ALTER TABLE ... ONLINE

Oracle 12c introduced `ONLINE` clause support for several `ALTER TABLE` operations, reducing lock contention.

### Adding Columns

```sql
-- Pre-12c: Adding a NOT NULL column with DEFAULT required a full table scan
-- and a row-by-row update, causing extended locks

-- 12c+: Adding NOT NULL with DEFAULT is metadata-only — instantaneous
ALTER TABLE ORDERS
ADD (LAST_MODIFIED TIMESTAMP DEFAULT SYSTIMESTAMP NOT NULL);
-- Oracle stores the default in the data dictionary; existing rows get the
-- default value at read time without a physical update

-- Explicitly mark the operation as online (no-op in 12c+ for this case, but explicit)
ALTER TABLE ORDERS ADD (AUDIT_USER VARCHAR2(100)) ONLINE;
```

### Modifying Column Definitions

```sql
-- Increase VARCHAR2 column width (always safe, no data conversion)
ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS MODIFY (EMAIL VARCHAR2(320)) ONLINE;

-- Add a DEFAULT to an existing nullable column
ALTER TABLE ORDERS MODIFY (NOTES VARCHAR2(4000) DEFAULT 'N/A') ONLINE;
```

### Setting Columns Unused

Rather than immediately dropping a column (which rewrites all rows), mark it unused first. The column becomes invisible to the application immediately, and the physical space is reclaimed later.

```sql
-- Step 1: Make the column invisible to the application (instant)
ALTER TABLE ORDERS SET UNUSED COLUMN LEGACY_REF_NUM;

-- Step 2: Reclaim space during a maintenance window or low-traffic period
ALTER TABLE ORDERS DROP UNUSED COLUMNS;

-- Check for unused columns
SELECT TABLE_NAME, COUNT(*) AS UNUSED_COLS
FROM   USER_UNUSED_COL_TABS
GROUP BY TABLE_NAME;
```

### Online Constraint Operations

```sql
-- Enable a disabled constraint without validating existing rows (fast, no lock)
ALTER TABLE ORDERS
ENABLE NOVALIDATE CONSTRAINT FK_ORDERS_CUSTOMER;

-- After verifying data quality, enable with full validation
-- (Does not prevent DML during the validation scan)
ALTER TABLE ORDERS
ENABLE VALIDATE CONSTRAINT FK_ORDERS_CUSTOMER;

-- Add a check constraint that is not validated (future rows only)
ALTER TABLE ORDERS
ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_STATUS CHECK (STATUS_CODE IN ('PENDING','PROCESSING','SHIPPED','CLOSED'))
ENABLE NOVALIDATE;
```

---

## Online Segment Shrink

Shrink reclaims space within a table segment caused by row deletions without moving the table or requiring downtime.

```sql
-- Step 1: Enable row movement (rows may change ROWID during shrink)
ALTER TABLE ORDERS ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;

-- Step 2: Compact rows (moves rows, frees space inside blocks; no HWM change yet)
ALTER TABLE ORDERS SHRINK SPACE COMPACT;
-- At this point DML is not blocked; rows are shifted within the segment

-- Step 3: Adjust High Water Mark (brief exclusive lock, very fast)
ALTER TABLE ORDERS SHRINK SPACE;

-- Alternative: do both steps at once (compact + HWM adjustment)
ALTER TABLE ORDERS SHRINK SPACE CASCADE;
-- CASCADE also shrinks all dependent indexes

-- After shrinking, disable row movement to re-lock ROWIDs
ALTER TABLE ORDERS DISABLE ROW MOVEMENT;
```

```sql
-- Monitor fragmentation before deciding to shrink
SELECT
    SEGMENT_NAME,
    BLOCKS,
    EMPTY_BLOCKS,
    NUM_ROWS,
    AVG_ROW_LEN,
    ROUND((BLOCKS * 8192) / 1024 / 1024, 2)          AS TOTAL_MB,
    ROUND((NUM_ROWS * AVG_ROW_LEN) / 1024 / 1024, 2)  AS DATA_MB
FROM
    USER_TABLES
WHERE
    SEGMENT_NAME = 'ORDERS';
```

## Minimizing Downtime: Strategy Summary

### Additive Changes (Zero Downtime)

These changes are always safe to apply while the application is running:

- Adding nullable columns (`ALTER TABLE ADD`)
- Adding NOT NULL columns with a DEFAULT value (12c+)
- Creating new indexes (`CREATE INDEX ... ONLINE`)
- Creating new tables, sequences, synonyms
- Adding new constraints with `ENABLE NOVALIDATE`
- Creating or replacing views, packages, procedures (if semantically compatible)

### Destructive or Risky Changes (Require Planning)

These changes require careful ordering or phased deployment:

| Change | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Dropping a column | Application may still reference it | Set UNUSED first; drop in next release |
| Renaming a column | Immediate application breakage | Add new column, migrate data, switch app, drop old |
| Changing column type | May block or fail on large tables | Use DBMS_REDEFINITION |
| Dropping/truncating a table | Immediate loss | Rename first; drop after application is updated |
| Converting heap to partitioned | Cannot do with ALTER TABLE | Use DBMS_REDEFINITION |

### The Expand/Contract Pattern

The safest approach for any non-additive change in a zero-downtime system is the expand/contract (or parallel change) pattern:

1. **Expand** — Add the new structure (new column, new table, new index) alongside the old. Write to both.
2. **Migrate** — Backfill existing data to the new structure. Verify consistency.
3. **Contract** — Remove the old structure after all application versions using it have been retired.

---

## Best Practices

- **Always run `DBMS_REDEFINITION.CAN_REDEF_TABLE` before attempting redefinition.** A failure mid-operation on a large table leaves more mess than never starting.
- **Monitor `V$SESSION_LONGOPS`** during online operations. These operations can run for hours on large tables; visibility into progress is critical.
- **Plan temporary space.** Online index builds and DBMS_REDEFINITION require additional storage: ~1x the original index size for online rebuild, ~1x the table size for full redefinition.
- **Rebuild with `PARALLEL` during low-traffic windows.** Even though online operations do not block DML, high-parallelism rebuilds consume significant I/O bandwidth. Reset `NOPARALLEL` after completion.
- **Use `NOLOGGING` for initial index builds, then `LOGGING` for maintenance.** `NOLOGGING` dramatically reduces redo generation but requires a backup immediately after.
- **Test online operations in non-production first.** Edge cases (LOB columns, domain indexes, spatial indexes) can prevent online operations from succeeding.

---

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake: Assuming online means instantaneous.**
Online operations complete without blocking application DML, but they still consume significant time, I/O, and temp space. A 500 GB table redefinition may take hours. Plan accordingly and monitor progress.

**Mistake: Forgetting to synchronize before FINISH_REDEF_TABLE.**
The final swap includes a synchronization step, but calling `SYNC_INTERIM_TABLE` multiple times beforehand reduces the time of the exclusive lock during cutover. Run several manual syncs in the hours before the planned cutover.

**Mistake: Using REBUILD ONLINE on bitmap indexes.**
Oracle will raise `ORA-08106`. Bitmap indexes cannot be created or rebuilt online. They must be rebuilt offline during a maintenance window.

**Mistake: Not disabling ROW MOVEMENT after a shrink.**
Leaving `ROW MOVEMENT ENABLED` permanently means ROWIDs are not stable. Any application or tool that caches ROWIDs for fast lookup will retrieve incorrect rows after a shrink.

**Mistake: Relying on SET UNUSED for data security.**
`SET UNUSED COLUMN` makes the column invisible to normal SQL but does not physically remove the data. The column data still exists in the data files. For sensitive data (PII, credentials), use a proper DELETE or UPDATE to nullify the column values before marking it unused.

## Oracle Version Notes (19c vs 26ai)

- Baseline guidance in this file is valid for Oracle Database 19c unless a newer minimum version is explicitly called out.
- Features marked as 21c, 23c, or 23ai should be treated as Oracle Database 26ai-capable features; keep 19c-compatible alternatives for mixed-version estates.
- For dual-support environments, test syntax and package behavior in both 19c and 26ai because defaults and deprecations can differ by release update.
