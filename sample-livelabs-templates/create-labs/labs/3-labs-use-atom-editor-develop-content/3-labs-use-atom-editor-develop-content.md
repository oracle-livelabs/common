# Use A Text Editor to Develop Markdown Content

## Introduction

You can use your preferred editor to author and edit your Markdown (.md) content for rendering the Workshop output.

> **Note:** Oracle recommends the UA Developers to use Atom.

### Objectives

* Learn about the tools that are available to develop and host your content.
* Learn how to merge content.
* Create workshop and lab content.
* Preview the content in a browser.


## Task 1: Install Your Text Editor

You can use your preferred editor, however we recommend to download either Atom or Visual Studio Code. Below, there are instructions for both.

### **Option 1: Install Atom**

`Atom.io` is a 3rd party IDE freely available under MIT License.

To install Atom:

1. Go to the [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.51.0) URL.
2. Click the zip file  for your operating system, save and extract the zip file.
  ![Installation of Atom.](./images/use-atom-editor-download.png " ")
3. From the extracted files, click `atom.exe` to launch Atom.

### **Option 2: Install Visual Studio Code**

To install Visual Studio Code:

1. Visit the [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) site and select the zip file for your operating system. In this case, we chose Mac OS.
  ![Downloading Visual Studio Code.](./images/vscode-os-options.png " ")
3. Double-click the zip file to expand it. The VS Code application will then show in your downloads folder in Finder.
  ![Install Visual Studio Code.](./images/vscode-zip-expanded.png " ")
4. Drag it to the Applications folder and double-click it to launch the text editor.
  ![Launch Visual Studio Code.](./images/vscode-drag.png " ")

## Task 2: Install Live Server

### **Option 1: Install Atom's Live Server Package**

You must NOT be connected to Oracle's network or VPN while installing the **atom-live-server** package.

To install **atom-live-server**:
1. In the **Atom** editor, click **Help**, and then select **Welcome Guide**.
2. In the **Welcome Guide** screen, click **Install a Package**, and then click **Open Installer** to display the **Install Packages** window.

  ![Install a package on Atom.](./images/use-atom-editor-welcome-install-package.png " ")

3. Enter **atom-live-server**, and then click **Install**.

  ![Install live server.](./images/use-atom-editor-welcome-install-package-atom-live-server.png " ")

4. When the installation is successfully completed, the **Install** button is replaced with the **Uninstall** and **Disable** buttons.
  ![Successful installation.](./images/use-atom-editor-welcome-uninstall-disable.png " ")
The **atom-live-server** plugin is added to the **Packages** menu.
  ![Atom live server is installed.](./images/use-atom-editor-welcome-atom-live-server-package-menu.png " ")

### **Option 2: Install Visual Studio Code's Live Server Extension**

1. Launch VS Code and navigate to the Extensions bar.
  ![Add extensions in visual studio code.](./images/extensions-tab.png " ")
2. Type "Live Server" into the search bar and select the first entry, "Live Server 5.6.1".
  ![Search for live server.](./images/ls-search.png " ")
3. Click "Install".
  ![Install live server.](./images/ls-install.png " ")

## Task 3: Merge Content from Git Before You Start Editing Your Content
  Everyday before you start editing your content, ensure to do a Merge in **GitHub Desktop**.
  Merging synchronizes the content in your cloned repository with the latest content on the **upstream/master** repository and ensures that you have the most recent versions of the templates and other workshops/labs.

  To merge content:
  1. Start your **GitHub Desktop** client.
  2. Select **Branch > Merge into current branch** to display the **Merge in Main** window.

    ![Merge current branch.](./images/git-hub-merge-current-branch.png " ")

  3. Under the **Default branch**, the master branch is selected by default. This indicates the local clone on your PC.
    ![Master branch is selected by default.](./images/git-hub-merge-local-clone-default-branch.png " ")

  4. Scroll down the **Merge into main** window, select **upstream/main** (this is your master repository which is the learning-library), and then click **Merge upstream/master into master**. In this example, this will merge 120 commits by other people from the **upstream/master** into the clone on the local PC.

    ![Merge into upstream main.](./images/git-hub-merge-upstream-master.png " ")

  5. When the merge is successfully completed, a **"Successfully merged upstream/main into main"** message is displayed. To push the new commits from the local clone to your forked location, click **Push origin**.

    > **Note:** To determine if your clone is up-to-date with **upstream/main** (production), repeat Steps 2 to 4. If both repositories are synchronized, then the following message is displayed: "This branch is up to date with **upstream/master**".

    ![This branch is up to date.](./images/git-hub-merge-branch-up-to-date.png " ")

  In the **GitHub Desktop** UI, notice that the **Push Origin** is replaced by **Fetch Origin** after the push origin operation is successfully completed.  The local clone and fork repositories are now synchronized with the master repository.

  ![Synchronized repositories.](./images/git-hub-merge-fetch-origin.png " ")

## Task 4: Create Your Labs and Workshop Content
Leverage the content from the **oracle-livelabs\common\sample-livelabs-templates\sample-workshop** folder to start creating lab and workshop content for your project.

*For screen shots of OCI menu navigation, use the images with absolute links in **Lab 1: Provision an Instance** markdown from the sample-workshop. A preview of the images can be found **[here](https://objectstorage.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/p/SJgQwcGUvQ4LqtQ9xGsxRcgoSN19Wip9vSdk-D_lBzi7bhDP6eG1zMBl0I21Qvaz/n/c4u02/b/common/o/sample-livelabs-templates/sample-workshop/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=provision)** under STEP 0.*

> **Note:** Ensure to update your clone from the **upstream/main** repository (detailed in **STEP 2**) on a regular basis whenever we are working on the markdown files.

To create your lab and workshop content:
1. Submit your workshop to the [LiveLabs Workshop Management System](http://bit.ly/oraclelivelabs) BEFORE you begin development.  No github requests will be approved without an approved WMS ID.
2. Open your cloned repository using Windows Explorer.
3. Create your project folder anywhere in your cloned repository. If a folder already exists  for the product you work on, then you can create your project folder within that.
4. Go to **oracle-livelabs\common\sample-livelabs-templates\sample-workshop**. This has a few lab folders, such as **analyze**, **query** etc. Every lab folder contains the following: a **files** folder, an **images** folder, and the respective `.md` file.
5. Copy any lab folder, such as the **query** folder to your project folder. In your project folder, rename the folder **query** and the respective `.md` file within it as per your requirement.  Based on the sample **query** folder, you can create and rename as many labs (folders) and the respective `.md` files as per your requirement.

  > **Note:** The **files** folder within every sample lab folder is currently not required and is reserved for future use.
  ![Files folder with sample labs.](./images/lab-files-folder-currently-not-nedded.png " ")
  After you copy the sample folder to your project folder, you can delete your copy of the **files** folder from your project folder.
  Your lab will look similar to this example:
  ![Example of your lab files folder.](./images/lab-folder-structure.png " ")

5. Similarly, copy the **workshops** folder along with its contents from **oracle-livelabs\common\sample-livelabs-templates\sample-workshop** to your project folder. For example, **GitHub\repo\sample-livelabs-templates\create-labs\labs**.
6. To edit the `.md` file of your lab, open your text editor (in this case, we're using Atom), click **File > Open Folder** to display the **Open Folder** dialog box. In VS code, you would click **File > Open**.
  ![Open project folder in Atom.](./images/use-atom-editor-open-folder.png " ")
7. Navigate to **GitHub\repo\sample-livelabs-templates\create-labs\labs** and click **Select Folder** to open your project folder.
  ![Navigate to your project folder.](./images/atom-editor-browse-select-lab.png " ")
  The project folder along with the labs and **workshops** folder will then be displayed in your text editor.
    ![Workshops folder displayed in text editor.](./images/atom-editor-project-folder-displayed.png " ")

8. Select the `.md` file you want to edit, for example, select the `1-labs-git-hub-get-started-install-configure.md` file and edit your lab content. Similarly, edit the `.md` files of the rest of your labs.
    ![Select markdown file to edit.](./images/atom-editor-browse-open-mdfile-editing.png " ")
9. If you want to add images in your lab, then include them within the **images** folder. You can insert images in the respective `.md` file.
10. Similarly to edit your workshop content, expand the **workshops\freetier** folder in your text editor, edit the `manifest.json` to list the labs you have added to your workshop (or plan to add) and update the title of the workshop. The `manifest.json` is like your book map file in SDL.
  ![Edit manifest json file with Atom.](./images/use-atom-editor-manifest-json.png " ")
11. If you want to add an introduction to your workshop, then navigate to **oracle-livelabs\common\sample-livelabs-templates\sample-workshop\introduction** and copy the `introduction.md` file to your **workshops\freetier** folder, for example: **GitHub\repo\create-labs\labs\workshops\freetier**. You can rename it if you would want to. In this example, we have renamed it to `intro.md`. Update the `intro.md` as per your requirements. Similarly, you can create a `README.md` file with the same `introduction.md` file and update the `README.md` with a summary of your workshop. Note that the `intro.md` and `README.md` files are optional files for your workshop's introduction. The workshop introduction can be treated as another lab.
    ![Introduction markdown file.](./images/use-atom-editor-readme-update.png " ")

    In this example, your project folder **labs** contains 5 labs and a workshop. Your **workshops\freetier** folder can be treated as another lab that includes an introduction to your workshop.
    ![Workshop folder structure in Atom.](./images/use-atom-editor-folder-structure-in-atom.png " ")

## Task 5: Security

1. Blur all personal information (IP addresses, intranet URLs, email addresses, OCIDs, usernames, and passwords) from images.
  ![Blur all identifiable information.](./images/blur-ip.png " ")

2. Every image must have a description: ![DESC] (…/…/name.png “ “)

  ![Every image must have a description.](./images/image-desc.png " ")

3. Do not use any IP addresses, intranet URLs (for example links to a Confluence page), email addresses, OCIDs, username, passwords in the text. Do not provide a demo password. 


## Task 6: Preview Your Workshop and Labs Using Live Server
### **Option 1: Using Atom**

1. First, start the **atom-live-server**. In the Atom editor, select **Packages > atom-live-server > Start server**.
  ![Start live server.](./images/use-atom-editor-packages-start-live-server.png " ")

  By default, the **atom-live-server** opens a browser window that displays the folders inside your project (**labs**) folder.
2. Click the **workshops** folder and then click **freetier** folder that contains the workshop you want to view.
  ![Select the workshop you want to view.](./images/use-atom-editor-open-live-server.png " ")

  The Workshop is displayed along with the labs. You can make content changes in the **Atom** editor to the workshop and lab files, save the changes, and the updated content gets automatically refreshed in the browser window.

  ![Workshop view in Live Server.](./images/use-atom-editor-workshop-output.png " ")

3. To stop the **atom-live-server**, go back to **Atom**, select  **Packages > atom-live-server > Stop folder-path-at-port-#**.

### **Option 2: Using Visual Studio Code**

1. Within the directory of any workshop you want to view, click the **workshops** folder and then click **freetier** folder.
  ![Navigate to freetier folder.](./images/folder-nav.png " ")
2. Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".
  ![Right click and select open with live server.](./images/right-click.png " ")
3. The local version of your workshop will then be launched in your web browser.

## Task 7: (Optional) Helpful resources and extensions for Visual Studio Code

1. [Showdown Editor](http://demo.showdownjs.com/) is a Javascript Markdown to HTML converter that LiveLabs uses in the background to convert Markdown files to HTML. This documentation is a helpful resource while developing content in markdown files. This document provides a quick description of the markdown syntax supported on the left side and the output in HTML format on the right side. Showdown Editor shows the syntax of writing, paragraphs, headings, block and italics, code formatting, creating lists, tables, adding links, images and escaping entities, etc.

	![Showdown Editor](./images/showdown-editor.png " ")

2. Set up tab spacing in Markdown files in Visual Studio Code - To have a fixed indentation and consistency in all the markdown files among the images, code snippets, and between the numbers in each task with the line starting, you need to set spaces to tabs (size 4).

	To set spaces to tabs size 4, click on spaces, choose indent with tabs, and select 4 as configured size, which sets the tab spacing to 4.

    ![click on spaces](./images/spacing1.png " ")

    ![choose indent with tabs](./images/spacing2.png " ")

    ![select 4 as configured size](./images/spacing3.png " ")

    ![tab spacing is set to 4](./images/spacing4.png " ")

3. Install Markdownlink Extension in Visual Studio Code - This extension is helpful to check markdown files linting and styling in VS Code. This extension has all library of rules to encourage standards and consistency for markdown files.

	To install this extension, search for markdownlint in the VS Code marketplace, select the first one and click on Install to install it.

    ![Markdownlink Extension](./images/markdownlink-extension.png " ")

4. Install Code Spell Checker Extension in Visual Studio Code - This extension is helpful to check to  spellings in the files.

	Search for the code spell checker in the VS Code marketplace, select the first one that doesn’t specify any language in the title, which is the English spell checker, and install it.

	![Code Spell Checker Extension](./images/code-spell-checker-extension.png " ")

5. Install Delete Trailing Spaces Extension in Visual Studio Code - Trailing space is all whitespace(s) located at the end of a line, without any other characters following it. This extension is helpful to resolve code blocks, copy and paste issues, and sometimes merge conflicts.

	To highlight trailing spaces, in the VS Code marketplace, search for trailing spaces and select the first trailing spaces, not the one with a fork, and click on Install. Once the extension is installed, you can see that whitespace(s) are highlighted in red to delete them.

	![Delete Trailing Spaces Extension](./images/delete-trailing-spaces-extension.png " ")

6. Install Path Intellisense Extension in Visual Studio Code - Since Oracle learning library has many files, you may want to access files in different folders of your workshop or sometimes in a different directory. To know the file, you are pointing to in the manifest.json file, you can use the path intellisense extension.

	To install this extension, search for path intellisense in VS Code marketplace, select the first extension and install it.

	![Path Intellisense Extension](./images/path-intellisense-extension.png " ")

	Use Path Intellisense Extension in manifest.json file - After typing black slash, hit enter to view or choose the folder(s) or file(s)

	![Use Path Intellisense Extension](./images/use-path-intellisense-extension1.png " ")

	![Use Path Intellisense Extension](./images/use-path-intellisense-extension2.png " ")

This concludes this lab. You may now proceed to the next lab.
