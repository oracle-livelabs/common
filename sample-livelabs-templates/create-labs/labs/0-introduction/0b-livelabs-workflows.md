## LiveLabs Workshop Workflow

You can watch the [video 0:18 - 16:35](https://otube.oracle.com/media/LiveLabs%20Workshops%20Workflow%20WMS%202.0%20-%20LiveLabs%20-%20Office%20Hours%20-%2002-01-2022/1_nc5xgue2) for an overview of LiveLabs workshop workflow and different statuses of a workshop.

Before you start, please check LiveLabs ([developer.oracle.com/livelabs](https://developer.oracle.com/livelabs)) to see if there is already a workshop similar to the content you want to create. Please also check WMS ([bit.ly/oraclewms](https://bit.ly/oraclewms)) to see if there is already a workshop in development that resembles your content. If so, please contact that workshop team to see if you can cooperate on the workshop. If not, please proceed.

In order for a workshop to go from an idea to a LiveLabs workshop in production, it has to go through the following phases or statuses in WMS. You can refer to this section to see your current and next steps.

1. After workshop team submits the workshop request (see details in Lab 1 -> Task 1), the workshop is in *Submitted* status. The workshop's *council* group will review the workshop within 2-3 business days. Council will either approve the workshop and move it to *Approved*, or ask the workshop team for more information and move it to *More Info Needed*.

> **Note:** If workshop teams have not heard back from council for more than 3 business days, please follow up with your council group. To find your council members, go to WMS, under **People & Role Reports**, select **Workshop Council Members**, and you can find your council members.
