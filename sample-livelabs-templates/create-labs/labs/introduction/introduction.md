> **Note:** Internal systems are not referenced by their URL.

Estimated Workshop Time: 240 min

Welcome to LiveLabs. This platform provides hands-on experiences for Oracle products and technologies, demonstrating use cases and helping users explore Oracle Cloud, Applications, and Database.

This workshop guides you through creating your own workshop, covering each step from development to publishing, including quality checks and the Workshop Management System (WMS) workflow.

## What Are Labs and Workshops?

A **lab** contains step-by-step instructions to complete a specific task. A **workshop** is a collection of labs arranged in a specific order. Each workshop should include an introduction and at least two labs.

Each lab consists of a Markdown (.md) file containing the instructions. The workshop manifest file determines the order of labs. Most LiveLabs workshops include a common **Get Started** lab that guides users through Cloud account options.

Markdown files and images are stored in the oracle-livelabs GitHub repository. Workshops are published to the LiveLabs platform.

### **What's Next?**

Before starting development:
- Browse existing workshops in LiveLabs for inspiration
- Check WMS to see workshops currently in development
- Review the videos in the WMS "Need Help" section

Use the sample workshop in the [oracle-livelabs/common](https://github.com/oracle-livelabs/common) repository under `sample-livelabs-templates` as your starting template. This repository also contains common images you can use in your workshop.

Review the QA document for image guidelines, markdown formatting, and workshop standards.

### **Workshop Objectives**

* Submit a new workshop in WMS
* Set up your development environment
* Learn Markdown features and best practices
* Perform QA on your workshop
* Publish your workshop
