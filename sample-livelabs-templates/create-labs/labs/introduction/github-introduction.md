# Introduction to Oracle GitHub Project and learning-library Repository

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based version control system designed for software developers.
  * At the core of GitHub is Git, an open source version control system that manages file versions and tracks the changes made by the members of a repository.
  * The Hub is a cloud-based repository that manages storage of the files and provides a folder structure.

### **GitHub Projects and Repositories**

GitHub is organized by projects. Each project has its own repository (commonly referred to as repo) that is accessed through a unique URL. As of January 2020, there were more than 190 million repositories on GitHub.

In the following simplified example, the three-drawer filing cabinet represents three GitHub projects (one drawer per project). Each project can contain one or more repositories, represented by folders in the example. In this example, project 2 (second drawer) has three repositories (folders) and we are viewing one of those repositories.

### **Oracle GitHub Project and learning-library Repository**

At Oracle, we have a GitHub project named **Oracle** which has **305** repositories as of March 15th, 2022. One of the repositories in the **Oracle** GitHub project is named **learning-library**. All of the LiveLabs workshops that you and others create are stored in the **learning-library** repository. This repo is sometimes referred to as **Production** since it's where customers view the completed LiveLabs workshops.

  The highlighted **sample-livelabs-templates** folder contains this workshop and also the available Livelabs templates.

  > **Note:** The term **learning-library** that we reference in this workshop is the GitHub repository for the **Oracle** GitHub project. It is NOT the same as **Oracle Learning Library (OLL)** used formerly in the OBE world. OLL is an online resource for content about Oracle products [https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:1](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:1).
