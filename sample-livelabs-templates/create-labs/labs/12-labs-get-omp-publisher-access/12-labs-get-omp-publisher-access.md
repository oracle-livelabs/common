# Get Publisher Access in Oracle Marketplace

Welcome! This quick guide will help you get publisher access on Oracle Marketplace.

## Objectives
- Get publisher access and start posting your offerings.

## Task 1: Get Publisher Access

1. Follow the [instructions provided by OMP](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/partnerLandingPage). If you already have an Oracle tenancy, you only need to complete steps 3 and 5.

2. After registering for an OMP publisher account (step 5), you will receive an approval email shortly. This means you are now able to create listings on Oracle Marketplace!
