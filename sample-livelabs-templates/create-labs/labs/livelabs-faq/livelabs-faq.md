        - The views report is only available to Oracle employees, you must login with your SSO to view it.
        - To get the view count, go to [LiveLabs](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=133:1) homepage, click the Question mark icon on the top right corner of the page, then select Dashboard.
        - Scroll down the Dashboard to the Workshop Views, select your workshop from the drop-down list.

6.	Which link should I share?
    -	Share only the Apex URLs for the workshops in production. This helps in tracking the views for the workshop by counting the number of hits on the Apex URL of the workshop.

Click on any of the brown buttons to view the workshop instructions.
11.	What to do if I am unable to launch green button?
    -	If you are already logged into your own tenancy when clicking on a Livelabs link, the livelabs reservation login link will skip the login (because according to the system you have already authenticated to your own tenancy) and tries to navigate to the assigned Livelabs tenancy. Please make sure you are logged off completely from your own tenancy or use another (private) browser window to connect.
12.	What is the difference is between LiveLabs vs Luna?
    -	The main difference between LiveLabs and Luna is use case. LiveLabs is a deal and consumption focused while Luna is learn focused. The goal of LiveLabs is not to learn but to drive customer consumption and support events. The combination of the two give a full solution for Oracle.
