_**IMPORTANT:** If you already have an RSA key pair in PEM format (minimum 2048 bits) and a fingerprint of the public key, you can skip this optional task and proceed to the next task in the workshop; however, going through this entire task might be easier for you. The **Console** displays the **Configuration file preview** dialog box that shows the **user ocid**, **fingerprint**, **tenancy ocid**, and **region**._ For additional information see the [How to Generate an API Signing Key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#two), [How to Get the Key's Fingerprint](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#four), and [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five) documentation resources.

In this optional task, you learn how to use the **Console** to generate the private/public key pair.

1. In the **Console** banner, click the **Profile** icon. From the drop-down menu, click your **User settings**.

2. The **My profile** page is displayed. 

    ![The My profile page is displayed.](./images/my-profile-page.png " ")

3. Click the **Tokens and keys** tab. In the **API keys** section of the page, click **Add API key**.

    ![Click Add API key.](./images/add-api-key-redwood.png " ")

    The **Add API key** panel is displayed.

4. Accept the default **Generate API key pair** option, and then click the **Download private key** tile. The private key is downloaded to your Web browser's default directory such as the **Downloads** folder in MS-Windows.

    >**Note:** You can also download the public key if you need it or for potential future use. click **Download Public Key**. Again, the public key is downloaded to your Web browser's default directory such as the **Downloads** folder in MS-Windows.

    The name of the downloaded private key is similar to the following:

    **`user-email-address-2025-06-11T17_43_34.851Z.pem`**

    You can rename your downloaded private key to something shorter such as:

    **`oci-api-private-key.pem`**

    Double-click the downloaded private key file to view its content. 

    ![Private key value.](./images/get-private-key-value.png " ")

5. Click **Add**. The key is added and the **Configuration file preview** panel is displayed. The file snippet includes required parameters and values you'll need to create your configuration file. For additional information, see [How to Generate an API Signing Key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#two).

    ![Configuration file preview.](./images/config-file-preview.png " ")

    This dialog box contains all of the information that you will need in the next task to create a new Cloud location and credential. Click the **Copy** link to copy the **User's OCID**, **API Key Fingerprint**, **Tenancy OCID**, and **Region** to your clipboard and then paste it into a text editor of your choice such as Notepad in MS-Windows. You will need those values in later tasks.

    ![Credentials items.](./images/rsa-key-pair-items.png " ")

    You can also copy the value of the downloaded private key and then paste it in the above text editor file for easier and faster access.

6. In the **Configuration File Preview** dialog box, click **Close**. The newly created fingerprint is displayed on the **Tokens and keys** page. you can click the **Actions** icon (ellipsis) to view the configuration file or to delete the fingerprint.
