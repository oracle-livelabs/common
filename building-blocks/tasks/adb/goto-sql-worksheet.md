Although you can connect to your Oracle Autonomous Database using desktop tools such as Oracle SQL Developer, you can conveniently access the browser-based SQL Worksheet directly from your Autonomous Database Console.

1. Log in to the **Oracle Cloud Console**, if you are not already logged as the Cloud Administrator, **`ADMIN`**.

2. Open the **Navigation** menu and click **Oracle Database**. Under **Oracle Database**, click **Autonomous Database**.

3. On the **Autonomous Databases** page, select your own compartment and region, and then click your ADB instance name, **`MyQuickStart`** in our example.

4. On the **Autonomous Database details** page, click the **Database actions** drop-down list, and then click **SQL**.

    ![From the Database Actions drop-down list, click SQL.](./images/click-db-actions-sql.png " ")

    The SQL Worksheet is displayed. The first time you access the SQL Worksheet, a **Logged in as ADMIN user** warning box and a **Run Statement** information box are displayed, close the boxes.
