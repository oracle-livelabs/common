Although you can connect to your Oracle Autonomous AI Database using desktop tools such as Oracle SQL Developer, you can conveniently access the browser-based SQL Worksheet directly from your Autonomous AI Database Console.

1. Log in to the **Oracle Cloud Console**, if you are not already logged as the Cloud Administrator, **`ADMIN`**.

2. Open the **Navigation** menu and click **Oracle AI Database**. Under **Oracle AI Database**, click **Autonomous AI Database**.

3. On the **Autonomous AI Databases** page, select your own compartment and region, and then click your ADB instance name, **`MyQuickStart`** in our example.
