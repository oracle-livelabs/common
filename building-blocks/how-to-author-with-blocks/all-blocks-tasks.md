## Variable Defaults
You can use the default variables or copy the default file to your project and override the settings. See the **Authoring using Blocks and Tasks** topic for details.

[View default variable values](/common/building-blocks/variables/variables.json)


## manifest.json Template
The manifest.json template below includes all the tasks that are currently available. You can remove those that you do not plan to use - either directly or thru a Block

The template assumes you copied the default **variables.json** to the same directory as the **manifest.json** file.
