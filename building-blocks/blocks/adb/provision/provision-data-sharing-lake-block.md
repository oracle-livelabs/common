# Set up the Workshop Environment

## Introduction

In just a few minutes, Autonomous AI Database lets you deploy a complete data warehousing platform that can scale to your requirements. And, you can use its Database Tools to easily populate that warehouse from the data lake.

This lab walks you through the steps to get started using the Oracle Autonomous AI Database (Lakehouse and Autonomous Transaction Processing) on Oracle Cloud Interface. In this lab, you provision a new ADW instance.

This workshop is directed at administrator users because they have the required privileges.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes
