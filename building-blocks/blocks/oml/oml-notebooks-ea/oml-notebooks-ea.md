### About Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks s an enhanced web-based notebook platform for data engineers, data analysts, R and Python users, and data scientists. You can write code, text, create visualizations, and perform data analytics and machine learning modeling. You can also leverage third-party packages from the R and Python ecosystems. In Oracle Machine Learning, notebooks are organized in projects, and projects within a workspace. You can create, edit, delete, copy, move, and version notebooks, and even save notebooks as private or sharable templates.

To support data science team collaboration, you can post  and respond to comments on individual paragraphs within a notebook and share notebooks as templates.
The Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks provides:
* Faster notebook loading time than the original notebook interface.
* The Oracle look and feel as it based on the Oracle Redwood theme.
* Enriched visualization in its line chart, area chart, bar chart, pyramid chart, pie chart, donut chart, funnel chart, tag Cloud, treemap diagram, sunburst diagram, scatter plot, box plot.
* Comments in notebook paragraphs to support team collaboration.
* Paragraph Dependencies, which allows you to add runtime sequence dependencies between paragraphs. The child paragraph automatically run after the parent paragraph is run.
* Simplified service level selection of High, Medium, Low through drop-down menu.
* Layout style of Zeppelin or Jupyter notebook interfaces.
* On-page versioning, viewing of version history, and version comparison.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:
* Access the enhanced notebook environment

Click **Back to Notebooks** to go to the OML Notebooks page.

## Task 3: Create a notebook and define paragraphs using the md, SQL, PL/SQL, Python, and R Interpreters

In this task, you will create a new notebook, and add paragraphs to connect to the Markdown, SQL, Script, Python, and R interpreters. Interpreters are independent backend engines. R and Python engines are stateful while the notebook is open, and database objects are valid for the duration the database connection is active. You can change the interpreter by explicitly specifying one of `%script`, `%python`, `%sql` , `%r` , `%md`, or `%conda` to connect to the respective interpreter.

To learn about Conda, refer to [Use the Conda Interpreter in a Notebook Paragraph](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml-notebooks/omlug/notebooks.html#GUID-0AAB3590-4422-450D-BE91-4EC435FD4254)

		![Create OML Notebooks](images/notebooks-ea-create.png)
2. In the Create Notebook dialog, enter the name `Test Notebook` in the **Name** field and click **OK.** The notebook is created and it opens in the notebook editor.
		![Create Notebook dialog](images/test-notebook-ea.png)

	You can now use the **Test Notebook** to create a Markdown paragraph, SQL paragraph, Python, R and Conda paragraphs.   

### Task 3.1: Use the Markdown interpreter and display static html from Markdown plain text

In this task, you will use the Markdown interpreter, and display the formatted text in the output of the markdown paragraph.
>*Note:* The first time a given interpreter type is accessed, the interpreter is started, which may take a few seconds to initialize and establish a connection to the database. Subsequent uses of the interpreter in later paragraphs will be immediate.

1. In the first paragraph, type `%md` and press Enter.
2. Type the following:
	* To format the text in bold, type the text Hello World inside a double asterisk pair, and press Enter.
	* To format the text in italics, type the text Hello World either inside an asterisk pair or an underscore pair, and click the Run

	Alternatively, you may copy the code and paste it in the notebook just below %md, and click the Run icon run icon as shown in the screenshot:
	```
	<copy>
	**Hello World**
  *Hello World*
  _Hello World_
	</copy>
	```

	After running the paragraph, the output is displayed, and a new paragraph is automatically created. Also, you can manually create additional paragraphs.
	![Markdown paragraph](images/test-nb-md-run.png)

3. Hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click ![add MD paragraph](images/add-md-para.png) to add another Markdown paragraph.

	![Add Markdown paragraph](images/add-md-para-icon.png)

4. To display the text in a bulleted list, prefix * (asterisk) to the text Hello World We welcome you, as shown in the screenshot below.

	```
	<copy>
	* Hello World
	* We welcome you
	</copy>

	```
5. Add another Markdown paragraph. Here, you will use Markdown tags to display the text in heading 1 (H1), heading 2 (H2) and heading 23 (H3). For H1, H2, and H3, add one, two, and three hashes before the text Hello World respectively.

	```
	<copy>
	# Hello World
	# Hello World
	### Hello World
	</copy>

	```
6. Now, scroll up the notebook and click the Run All icon present in the notebook toolbar, as shown in the screenshot here.

	![Run all paragraphs](images/test-nb-run-all.png)

7. A message appears asking you to confirm whether to run all the paragraphs of the notebook. Click **Confirm.**
	![Confirm Run all](images/confirm-run.png)

	The two paragraphs run and the output is displayed in the respective paragraphs, as shown in the screenshot.
		![Markdown paragraphs output](images/md-output2.png)
This completes the task of using the Markdown interpreter to generate HTML in your notebook. 
### Task 3.2: Use the SQL Interpreter and run SQL Statements

Let’s create another paragraph to use the SQL interpreter and run SQL statements:

>*Note:* The first time a given interpreter type is accessed, the interpreter is started, which may take a few seconds to initialize and establish a connection to the database. Subsequent uses of the interpreter in later paragraphs will be immediate.

1. To create a SQL paragraph, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add sql Paragraph** icon to add a SQL paragraph.

	![Add SQL paragraph icon](images/add-sql-toolbar.png)

	You may also choose to click on the Add Paragraph icon ![Add](images/add.png) to manually create a new paragraph. Then type  ``%sql``  and press Enter to call the SQL interpreter.

2. Type the following command and click the run icon .

	```
	<copy>
	select * from SH.COUNTRIES
	</copy>
	```

	* The command returns the COUNTRIES table present in the SH schema in a tabular format, as shown in the screenshot. You can also view the data in various visual format by clicking on any of the chart icons, as highlighted in the screenshot here:
	![SQL paragraph output](images/sql-output.png)

	* Click on the histogram icon to view the table in a histogram. Hover your cursor over each bar to view the details for each country:
	![SQL paragraph output](images/sql-output-histogram.png)
	* You can adjust the settings and visual output by clicking on the **Settings** icon on the paragraph toolbar, highlighted in red. Clicking the settings icon opens the **Settings** dialog. Here, click on the **Setup** tab to customize the output to view.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings.png)
	* Click on each of the fields to choose various output options. In this customized output, the COUNTRY REGION ID and COUNTRY NAME in the **Series to Show** and **Group By** fields respectively. The histogram now shows an additional series - country region and the full name of the country along with the country code.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings2.png)
	* Click on the **Height** field and enter values as applicable to adjust the setting to allow scrolling and limit vertical height of the result.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings3.png)
	* Click on the **Customization** tab in the **Settings** dialog to customize the visualization. Here, the layout of the histogram is changed to horizontal and the color is changed to red for the series COUNTRY NAME.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings-cust.png)

This completes the task of connecting to the SQL interpreter and running SQL commands in your notebook. 
### Task 3.3: Use the PL/SQL Interpreter and run PL/SQL Scripts

In this task, you will create another paragraph to call the PL/SQL interpreter and run PL/SQL scripts:

1. To create a PL/SQL paragraph, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add sql Script Paragraph** icon to add a PL/SQL paragraph.
	![Add PLSQL paragraph](images/add-sql-script-toolbar.png)

2. Type the following command and click the run icon. Alternatively, you can press Shift+Enter keys to run the paragraph.

	```
	<copy>
	CREATE TABLE small_table
	(
	NAME VARCHAR(200),
	ID1 INTEGER,
	ID2 VARCHAR(200),
	ID3 VARCHAR(200),
	ID4 VARCHAR(200),
	TEXT VARCHAR(200)
	);

	BEGIN
	FOR i IN 1..100 LOOP
	INSERT INTO small_table VALUES ('Name_'||i, i,'ID2_'||i,'ID3_'||i,'ID4_'||i,'TEXT_'||i);
	END LOOP;
	COMMIT;
	END;
	</copy>
	```
	The PL/SQL script successfully creates the table SMALL_TABLE. The PL/SQL script in this example contains two parts:
	* The first part of the script contains the SQL statement CREATE TABLE to create a table named small_table. It defines the table name, table column, data types, and size. In this example, the column names are NAME, ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4, and TEXT.

	* The second part of the script begins with the keyword BEGIN. It inserts 100 rows into the table small_table


	![PLSQL output](images/plsql-output.png)
This completes the task of connecting to the PL/SQL interpreter and running PL/SQL scripts in your notebook.  
### Task 3.4: Use the Python Interpreter and run Python Statements
Let’s create another paragraph to call the Python interpreter and run Python statements:

1. To connect to the Python interpreter, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add OML4Py Paragraph** icon.
	![Add OML4Py Paragraph](images/add-py-para-toolbar.png)

2. Type the following command and click the run icon.

	```
	<copy>
	import pandas as pd
	import oml
	DATA = oml.sync(table = "SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS", schema = "SH")
	z.show(DATA.head())
	</copy>
	```
	The z.show command displays the SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS table present in the SH schema, as shown in the screenshot here. Use the z.show command to display Python objects, proxy object content, and to display the desired data in the notebook. You will learn more about z.show in the lab on Oracle Machine Learning for Python.

	![OML4Py output](images/py-output.png)

This completes the task of connecting to the Python interpreter and running Python commands in your notebook.
### Task 3.5: Use the R Interpreter and run R Statements
Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R) makes the open source R scripting language and environment ready for the enterprise and big data. OML4R integrates R with Oracle Autonomous Database. It allows you to run R commands and scripts for statistical, machine learning, and visualization analyses on database tables and views using R syntax.

In this task, you will use the R interpreter and run R statements:

* Import R Libraries
* Create a database table
* Explore and visualize the data

>*Note:* The ORE library is pre-loaded and available.

1. To connect to the R interpreter, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add OML4R Paragraph** icon.
	![Add R Paragraph](images/add-r-para-toolbar.png)
2. To import R Libraries, run the following command:

 	```
	<copy>
	%r
	library(ORE)
	library(lattice)

	options(ore.warn.order=FALSE)
	</copy>
	```
	![Load R libraries](images/load-ore-lattice.png)

3. In this step, we load the IRIS data from a R data.frame into the database by using the `ore.push` function. This function creates the temporary table `IRIS_TMP` and returns a proxy object to which the variable IRIS_TMP is assigned. Run the following command:

	```
	<copy>
	%r
	IRIS_TMP <- ore.push(iris)
	dim(IRIS_TMP)
	colnames(IRIS_TMP)
	z.show(head(IRIS_TMP,10))
	</copy>
	```
	![Create IRIS table](images/create-iris-temp.png)

	Scroll down to view the table:
	![View IRIS table](images/iris-temp-table.png)

4. Run the following command to visualize the data in a histogram. In the histogram, the sepal length of the flower is plotted along the X-axis, and the frequency or count of the iris flower is plotted along the y-axis.   	

	```
	<copy>
	%r

	hist(IRIS_TMP$Sepal.Length, col="darkred")
	</copy>
	```

	![Explore data in histogram](images/iris-temp-histogram.png)
5. Run the following command to visualize the attribute distribution of the sepal length of the iris flower in a boxplot. The boxplot shows the distribution in quartiles.

	```
	<copy>
	%r

	boxplot(IRIS_TMP$Sepal.Length, horizontal=TRUE, notch=TRUE, col="darkgreen",
		        showmeans=TRUE, xlab="cm", main="Distribution of IRIS Attributes")
	</copy>					
	```

	![Attribute distribution in boxplot](images/boxplot-iris-attribute-dist.png)

This completes the task of connecting to the R interpreter and running R commands in your notebook.


## Task 4: Work with notebook features

Upon creating a notebook, it opens automatically, presenting you with a single paragraph using the default ``%sql`` interpreter. You can change the interpreter by explicitly specifying one of ``%script``, ``%python``, ``%sql`` , ``%r`` , ``%md``, or ``%conda`` to connect to the respective interpreter.

### Task 6.2: Create Versions in the Notebooks Editor
By creating versions of your notebook, you can archive your work in a notebook. You can create versions of an open notebook, as well as on the notebooks listing page. In this example:

* The original notebook _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_, is edited to add a script to build a machine learning model.
* The notebook _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ is then versioned as **Version 2** to archive the code to build the machine learning model.
* The **Version 2** and **Version 1** of the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook are compared using the **Compare Versions** feature.


>**Note:** A versioned notebook is non-editable. If you want to make any changes to a particular version of a notebook, you must restore that version to edit it.

To create a new notebook version and view version history:
1. On the Notebooks page, click on the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook to open it in the notebook editor.
	> **Note:**  **Version 1** of this notebook is already created as part Task 6.1 in this lab. It contains the archived code to create the view ESM_SH_DATA, count the number of records, and view the data. Clicking on the notebook opens the original editable version.

	![Notebooks versions page](images/click-para-dep-nb.png)

2. Now, edit the notebook to add a script to build a machine learning model. On the notebook, hover your cursor over the lower border of the third paragraph, and click the **Add SQL Script Paragraph**  to call the PL/SQL Interpreter.

	![Add PL/SQL Paragraph](images/add-sql-script-toolbar.png)

3. Copy and paste the following script to the new paragraph. This script builds a machine learning model using the ESM algorithm.

	```
	<copy>
		BEGIN DBMS_DATA_MINING.DROP_MODEL('ESM_SALES_FORECAST_1');
	EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; END;
	/
	DECLARE
	    v_setlst DBMS_DATA_MINING.SETTING_LIST;
	BEGIN

	    v_setlst('ALGO_NAME')            := 'ALGO_EXPONENTIAL_SMOOTHING';
	    v_setlst('EXSM_INTERVAL')        := 'EXSM_INTERVAL_QTR'; -- accumulation int'l = quarter
	    v_setlst('EXSM_PREDICTION_STEP') := '4';                 -- prediction step = 4 quarters
	    v_setlst('EXSM_MODEL')           := 'EXSM_WINTERS';      -- ESM model = Holt-Winters
	    v_setlst('EXSM_SEASONALITY')     := '4';                 -- seasonal cycle = 4 quarters    

	    DBMS_DATA_MINING.CREATE_MODEL2(
	        MODEL_NAME          => 'ESM_SALES_FORECAST_1',
	        MINING_FUNCTION     => 'TIME_SERIES',
	        DATA_QUERY          => 'select * from ESM_SH_DATA',
	        SET_LIST            => v_setlst,
	        CASE_ID_COLUMN_NAME => 'TIME_ID',
	        TARGET_COLUMN_NAME  =>'AMOUNT_SOLD');
	END;
	</copy>
	```
4. Now, archive this notebook along with the code to build the machine learning model by versioning it. On the top left corner of the notebook editor, click the Versioning icon.

	![Notebooks versions page](images/create-version2.png)

5. The options to **Create Version** and **View Version History** opens. Click **Create Version**.

	![Notebooks versions page](images/create-version-option.png)

6. In the New Version dialog:

	* **Name:** Here, the name Version 2 is taken by default. Let's retain this name.
	* **Description:** Enter notes, if any.
	* Click **Create.**
	![Notebooks versions page](images/create-version2-dialog.png)
	* A message is displayed confirming the creation of the new version.
