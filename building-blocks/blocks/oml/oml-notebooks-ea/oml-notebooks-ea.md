## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to sign into Oracle Machine Learning UI, create an Oracle Machine Learning (OML) notebook from scratch using the notebook environment, and explore the features.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### About Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks is a web-based notebook platform for data engineers, data analysts, R and Python users, and data scientists. You can write code, text, create visualizations, and perform data analytics and machine learning modeling. You can also leverage third-party packages from the R and Python ecosystems. In Oracle Machine Learning, notebooks are organized in projects, and projects within a workspace. You can create, edit, delete, copy, move, and version notebooks, and even save notebooks as private or sharable templates.

To support data science team collaboration, you can post  and respond to comments on individual paragraphs within a notebook and share notebooks as templates.
The Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks provides:
* Faster notebook loading time than the original notebook interface.
* The Oracle look and feel as it based on the Oracle Redwood theme.
* Enriched visualization in its line chart, area chart, bar chart, pyramid chart, pie chart, donut chart, funnel chart, tag Cloud, treemap diagram, sunburst diagram, scatter plot, box plot.
* Comments in notebook paragraphs to support team collaboration.
* Paragraph Dependencies, which allows you to add runtime sequence dependencies between paragraphs. The child paragraph automatically run after the parent paragraph is run.
* Simplified service level selection of High, Medium, Low through drop-down menu.
* Layout style of Zeppelin or Jupyter notebook interfaces.
* On-page versioning, viewing of version history, and version comparison.

## Task 3: Create a Notebook and Define Paragraphs using the md, SQL, PL/SQL, Python, and R Interpreters

In this task, you will create a new notebook, and add paragraphs to connect to the Markdown, SQL, Script, Python, and R interpreters. Interpreters are independent backend engines. R and Python engines are stateful while the notebook is open, and database objects are valid for the duration the database connection is active. You can change the interpreter by explicitly specifying one of `%script`, `%python`, `%sql` , `%r` , `%md`, or `%conda` to connect to the respective interpreter.

To learn about Conda, refer to [Use the Conda Interpreter in a Notebook Paragraph](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml-notebooks/omlug/run-notebook-conda-interpreter.html).

1. On the Notebooks page, click **Create.**
		![Create OML Notebooks](images/notebooks-ea-create.png)
2. In the Create Notebook dialog, enter the name `Test Notebook` in the **Name** field and click **OK.** The notebook is created and it opens in the notebook editor.
		![Create Notebook dialog](images/test-notebook-ea.png)

	You can now use the **Test Notebook** to create a Markdown paragraph, SQL paragraph, Python, R and Conda paragraphs.   

### Task 3.1: Use the Markdown interpreter and display static html from Markdown plain text

In this task, you will use the Markdown interpreter, and display the formatted text in the output of the markdown paragraph.
>*Note:* The first time a given interpreter type is accessed, the interpreter is started, which may take a few seconds to initialize and establish a connection to the database. Subsequent uses of the interpreter in later paragraphs will be immediate.

1. In the first paragraph, type `%md` and press Enter.
2. Type the following:
	* To format the text in bold, type the text Hello World inside a double asterisk pair, and press Enter.
	* To format the text in italics, type the text Hello World either inside an asterisk pair or an underscore pair, and click the Run

	Alternatively, you may copy the code and paste it in the notebook just below %md, and click the Run icon run icon as shown in the screenshot:
	```
	<copy>
	**Hello World**
  *Hello World*
  _Hello World_
	</copy>
	```

	After running the paragraph, the output is displayed, and a new paragraph is automatically created. Also, you can manually create additional paragraphs.
	![Markdown paragraph](images/test-nb-md-run.png)

3. Hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click ![add MD paragraph](images/add-md-para.png) to add another Markdown paragraph.

	![Add Markdown paragraph](images/add-md-para-icon.png)

4. To display the text in a bulleted list, prefix * (asterisk) to the text Hello World We welcome you, as shown in the screenshot below.

	```
	<copy>
	* Hello World
	* We welcome you
	</copy>

	```
5. Add another Markdown paragraph. Here, you will use Markdown tags to display the text in heading 1 (H1), heading 2 (H2) and heading 23 (H3). For H1, H2, and H3, add one, two, and three hashes before the text Hello World respectively.

	```
	<copy>
	# Hello World
	# Hello World
	### Hello World
	</copy>

	```
6. Now, scroll up the notebook and click the Run All icon present in the notebook toolbar, as shown in the screenshot here.

	![Run all paragraphs](images/test-nb-run-all.png)

7. A message appears asking you to confirm whether to run all the paragraphs of the notebook. Click **Confirm.**
	![Confirm Run all](images/confirm-run.png)

	The two paragraphs run and the output is displayed in the respective paragraphs, as shown in the screenshot.
		![Markdown paragraphs output](images/md-output2.png)
This completes the task of using the Markdown interpreter to generate HTML in your notebook. 
### Task 3.2: Use the SQL Interpreter and run SQL Statements

Let’s create another paragraph to use the SQL interpreter and run SQL statements:

>*Note:* The first time a given interpreter type is accessed, the interpreter is started, which may take a few seconds to initialize and establish a connection to the database. Subsequent uses of the interpreter in later paragraphs will be immediate.

1. To create a SQL paragraph, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add sql Paragraph** icon to add a SQL paragraph.

	![Add SQL paragraph icon](images/add-sql-toolbar.png)

	You may also choose to click on the Add Paragraph icon ![Add](images/add.png) to manually create a new paragraph. Then type ``%sql`` and press Enter to call the SQL interpreter.

2. Type the following command and click the run icon .

	```
	<copy>
	select * from SH.COUNTRIES
	</copy>
	```

	* The command returns the COUNTRIES table present in the SH schema in a tabular format, as shown in the screenshot. You can also view the data in various visual format by clicking on any of the chart icons, as highlighted in the screenshot here:
	![SQL paragraph output](images/sql-output.png)

	* Click on the histogram icon to view the table in a histogram. Hover your cursor over each bar to view the details for each country:
	![SQL paragraph output](images/sql-output-histogram.png)
	* You can adjust the settings and visual output by clicking on the **Settings** icon on the paragraph toolbar, highlighted in red. Clicking the settings icon opens the **Settings** dialog. Here, click on the **Setup** tab to customize the output to view.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings.png)
	* Click on each of the fields to choose various output options. In this customized output, the COUNTRY REGION ID and COUNTRY NAME in the **Series to Show** and **Group By** fields respectively. The histogram now shows an additional series - country region and the full name of the country along with the country code.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings2.png)
	* Click on the **Height** field and enter values as applicable to adjust the setting to allow scrolling and limit vertical height of the result.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings3.png)
	* Click on the **Customization** tab in the **Settings** dialog to customize the visualization. Here, the layout of the histogram is changed to horizontal and the color is changed to red for the series COUNTRY NAME.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings-cust.png)

This completes the task of connecting to the SQL interpreter and running SQL commands in your notebook. 
### Task 3.3: Use the PL/SQL Interpreter and run PL/SQL Scripts

In this task, you will create another paragraph to call the PL/SQL interpreter and run PL/SQL scripts:

1. To create a PL/SQL paragraph, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add sql Script Paragraph** icon to add a PL/SQL paragraph.
	![Add PLSQL paragraph](images/add-sql-script-toolbar.png)

2. Type the following command and click the run icon. Alternatively, you can press Shift+Enter keys to run the paragraph.

	```
	<copy>
	CREATE TABLE small_table
	(
	NAME VARCHAR(200),
	ID1 INTEGER,
	ID2 VARCHAR(200),
	ID3 VARCHAR(200),
	ID4 VARCHAR(200),
	TEXT VARCHAR(200)
	);

	BEGIN
	FOR i IN 1..100 LOOP
	INSERT INTO small_table VALUES ('Name_'||i, i,'ID2_'||i,'ID3_'||i,'ID4_'||i,'TEXT_'||i);
	END LOOP;
	COMMIT;
	END;
	</copy>
	```
	The PL/SQL script successfully creates the table SMALL_TABLE. The PL/SQL script in this example contains two parts:
	* The first part of the script contains the SQL statement CREATE TABLE to create a table named small_table. It defines the table name, table column, data types, and size. In this example, the column names are NAME, ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4, and TEXT.

	* The second part of the script begins with the keyword BEGIN. It inserts 100 rows into the table small_table


	![PLSQL output](images/plsql-output.png)
This completes the task of connecting to the PL/SQL interpreter and running PL/SQL scripts in your notebook.  
### Task 3.4: Use the Python Interpreter and run Python Statements
Let’s create another paragraph to call the Python interpreter and run Python statements:

1. To connect to the Python interpreter, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add OML4Py Paragraph** icon.
	![Add OML4Py Paragraph](images/add-py-para-toolbar.png)

2. Type the following command and click the run icon.

	```
	<copy>
	import pandas as pd
	import oml
	DATA = oml.sync(table = "SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS", schema = "SH")
	z.show(DATA.head())
	</copy>
	```
	The z.show command displays the SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS table present in the SH schema, as shown in the screenshot here. Use the z.show command to display Python objects, proxy object content, and to display the desired data in the notebook. You will learn more about z.show in the lab on Oracle Machine Learning for Python.

	![OML4Py output](images/py-output.png)

This completes the task of connecting to the Python interpreter and running Python commands in your notebook.
### Task 3.5: Use the R Interpreter and run R Statements
Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R) makes the open source R scripting language and environment ready for the enterprise and big data. OML4R integrates R with Oracle Autonomous Database. It allows you to run R commands and scripts for statistical, machine learning, and visualization analyses on database tables and views using R syntax.

In this task, you will use the R interpreter and run R statements:

* Import R Libraries
* Create a database table
* Explore and visualize the data

>*Note:* The ORE library is pre-loaded and available.

1. To connect to the R interpreter, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add OML4R Paragraph** icon.
	![Add R Paragraph](images/add-r-para-toolbar.png)
2. To import R Libraries, run the following command:

 	```
	<copy>
	%r
	library(ORE)
	library(lattice)

	options(ore.warn.order=FALSE)
	</copy>
	```
	![Load R libraries](images/load-ore-lattice.png)

3. In this step, run the following script in an R paragraph to create the Iris dataset:

	```
	<copy>
	%r
	library(ORE)

	if (ore.exists("IRIS_R")) ore.drop(table="IRIS_R")

	ore.create(iris, table = "IRIS_R", overwrite=TRUE)

	ore.exec("ANALYZE TABLE IRIS_R COMPUTE STATISTICS")

	z.show(cat("Shape:", dim(IRIS_R)))
	</copy>
	```
	![Create IRIS table](images/create-iris-temp.png)

	
4. 	Run the following SQL command to view the dataset:

	```
	<copy>
	%sql
	select * from OMLUSER.IRIS_R
	</copy>
	```
	![View IRIS table](images/iris-temp-table.png)



This completes the task of connecting to the R interpreter and running R commands in your notebook.


## Task 4: Work with Notebook Features

## Task 5: Visualize your Data in OML Notebooks

OML Notebooks offer rich visualization capabilities of your data. The visualizations depend on the type of your dataset.
The following visualization options are available.  

* Table - A table is an arrangement of information or data in rows and columns. Using OML Notebooks, you can create database tables, and also view the information in a tabular format. 
* Area Chart - An area chart uses lines to connect the data points and fills the area below these lines to the x-axis. Each data series contributes to the formation of a distinct shaded region. This emphasizes its contribution to the overall trend. As the data points fluctuate, the shaded areas expand or contract.
* Bar Graph - A bar graph is a graphical representation of data in rectangular bars. The length and height  of the bars, depending on the horizontal or vertical orientation, depict the dataset distribution. One axis represents a category, while the other represents values or counts.
* Funnel Chart - A funnel chart is a graphical representation that resembles the shape of a funnel where each segment gets progressively narrower. The segments are arranged vertically and depict a hierarchy. Within the funnel chart, each segment corresponds to a step or stage in a sequential process.
* Line Chart - A line chart is a graphical representation used to display data points connected by straight lines.
* Pie Chart - A pie chart is a graphical representation of data in a circular form, with each slice of the circle representing a fraction that is a proportionate part of the whole.
* Pyramid Chart - Pyramid charts present your data in a distinctive triangular configuration, horizontally segmented into partitions. Each segment in the pyramid charts represents points or steps in ascending or descending order. 
* Box Plot - A box plot provides an overview of data distributions in numeric data. It provides general information about the symmetry, skewness, variance, and outliers in a dataset. The box plot uses boxes and lines to depict the data distribution. 
* Scatter Plot - Scatter plots represent the relationship between two numeric variables in a data set. It represents data points on a two-dimensional plane and show how much one variable is affected by another. The independent variable is plotted on the X-axis, while the dependent variable is plotted on the Y-axis. You can display points by one or more grouping variables such that each group has a distinct color and shape. 
* Tree Map - A treemap is a visualization composed of nested rectangles, that represent certain categories within a selected dimension and are ordered in a hierarchy, or “tree.” Quantities and patterns can be compared and displayed in a limited chart space. Treemaps also show the relationship of each part (or nested rectangles) to the whole (tree). 
* Sun-burst - The sunburst chart is typically used to visualize hierarchical data structures - with part-to-whole relationships in data depicted additionally.
* Tag Cloud - A tag cloud is a visual representation of the most popular words (or tags) found in free-form text.
* Maps - Map plots display data points on a geographical map.

To visualize your data, let's consider the _Test Notebook_ that you created in **Task 3-Create a Notebook and Define Paragraphs using the md, SQL, PL/SQL, Python, and R Interpreters** in this lab. 

1. Open the _Test Notebook_ and go to the paragraph where you created and viewed the Iris dataset in a table. The tabular format presents the data in rows and columns. The Iris data set contains:
	* Three classes (three different species of the Iris flower) - Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. 
	* Four numeric properties about those classes - Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. 

	![View IRIS table](images/iris-temp-table.png)

2. On the paragraph notebook toolbar, click on the pie chart icon. The tabular data is now rendered in a pie chart. The size of each slice of the pie chart represents a fraction that is proportionate to the whole. It also depicts the percentage of each class. Hover your cursor over each slice to view additional details about the respective class it represents. 	

	![pie-chart](images/pie-chart.png)

3. You may also visualize this dataset in a box plot by clicking on the box plot icon. The box plot shows the data distribution of the 3 classes - Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Hover your cursor over each slice to view additional details such as the inter-quartile ranges and quartiles, outliers (additional customization required) and so on for each class. This box plot displays the data for one property (sepal length) for the three classes. You can customize the box plot view all the properties of the three classes. 

	Visualization of the data in a box plot.  

	![boxplot](images/boxplot1.png)
	 
4. The output in any of the visualization option depends on the default visualization behavior. The tool automatically selects the columns to show. You can change these settings. 

	Click the Settings icon ![Settings icon](images/settings-icon.png) to open the Settings dialog. 
	* In the **Setup** tab, you have the option to increase or decrease the height of the box plot, select or deselect columns (series) to display, and so on.
