# Introduction to Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks 

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to sign into Oracle Machine Learning UI, create an Oracle Machine Learning (OML) notebook from scratch using the notebook environment, and explore the features.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### About Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks is a web-based notebook platform for data engineers, data analysts, R and Python users, and data scientists. You can write code, text, create visualizations, and perform data analytics and machine learning modeling. You can also leverage third-party packages from the R and Python ecosystems. In Oracle Machine Learning, notebooks are organized in projects, and projects within a workspace. You can create, edit, delete, copy, move, and version notebooks, and even save notebooks as private or sharable templates.

To support data science team collaboration, you can post  and respond to comments on individual paragraphs within a notebook and share notebooks as templates.
The Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks provides:
* Faster notebook loading time than the original notebook interface.
* The Oracle look and feel as it based on the Oracle Redwood theme.
* Enriched visualization in its line chart, area chart, bar chart, pyramid chart, pie chart, donut chart, funnel chart, tag Cloud, treemap diagram, sunburst diagram, scatter plot, box plot.
* Comments in notebook paragraphs to support team collaboration.
* Paragraph Dependencies, which allows you to add runtime sequence dependencies between paragraphs. The child paragraph automatically run after the parent paragraph is run.
* Simplified service level selection of High, Medium, Low through drop-down menu.
* Layout style of Zeppelin or Jupyter notebook interfaces.
* On-page versioning, viewing of version history, and version comparison.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:
* Access the notebook environment
* Create and run a Notebook
* Edit notebooks

Click **Back to Notebooks** to go to the OML Notebooks page.

## Task 3: Create a notebook and define paragraphs using the md, SQL, PL/SQL, Python, and R Interpreters

In this task, you will create a new notebook, and add paragraphs to connect to the Markdown, SQL, Script, Python, and R interpreters. Interpreters are independent backend engines. R and Python engines are stateful while the notebook is open, and database objects are valid for the duration the database connection is active. You can change the interpreter by explicitly specifying one of `%script`, `%python`, `%sql` , `%r` , `%md`, or `%conda` to connect to the respective interpreter.

To learn about Conda, refer to [Use the Conda Interpreter in a Notebook Paragraph](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml-notebooks/omlug/notebooks.html#GUID-0AAB3590-4422-450D-BE91-4EC435FD4254)

1. On the Notebooks page, click **Create.**
		![Create OML Notebooks](images/notebooks-ea-create.png)
2. In the Create Notebook dialog, enter the name `Test Notebook` in the **Name** field and click **OK.** The notebook is created and it opens in the notebook editor.
		![Create Notebook dialog](images/test-notebook-ea.png)

	You can now use the **Test Notebook** to create a Markdown paragraph, SQL paragraph, Python, R and Conda paragraphs.   

### Task 3.1: Use the Markdown interpreter and display static html from Markdown plain text

In this task, you will use the Markdown interpreter, and display the formatted text in the output of the markdown paragraph.
>*Note:* The first time a given interpreter type is accessed, the interpreter is started, which may take a few seconds to initialize and establish a connection to the database. Subsequent uses of the interpreter in later paragraphs will be immediate.

1. In the first paragraph, type `%md` and press Enter.
2. Type the following:
	* To format the text in bold, type the text Hello World inside a double asterisk pair, and press Enter.
	* To format the text in italics, type the text Hello World either inside an asterisk pair or an underscore pair, and click the Run

	Alternatively, you may copy the code and paste it in the notebook just below %md, and click the Run icon run icon as shown in the screenshot:
	```
	<copy>
	**Hello World**
  *Hello World*
  _Hello World_
	</copy>
	```

	After running the paragraph, the output is displayed, and a new paragraph is automatically created. Also, you can manually create additional paragraphs.
	![Markdown paragraph](images/test-nb-md-run.png)

3. Hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click ![add MD paragraph](images/add-md-para.png) to add another Markdown paragraph.

	![Add Markdown paragraph](images/add-md-para-icon.png)

4. To display the text in a bulleted list, prefix * (asterisk) to the text Hello World We welcome you, as shown in the screenshot below.

	```
	<copy>
	* Hello World
	* We welcome you
	</copy>

	```
5. Add another Markdown paragraph. Here, you will use Markdown tags to display the text in heading 1 (H1), heading 2 (H2) and heading 23 (H3). For H1, H2, and H3, add one, two, and three hashes before the text Hello World respectively.

	```
	<copy>
	# Hello World
	# Hello World
	### Hello World
	</copy>

	```
6. Now, scroll up the notebook and click the Run All icon present in the notebook toolbar, as shown in the screenshot here.

	![Run all paragraphs](images/test-nb-run-all.png)

7. A message appears asking you to confirm whether to run all the paragraphs of the notebook. Click **Confirm.**
	![Confirm Run all](images/confirm-run.png)

	The two paragraphs run and the output is displayed in the respective paragraphs, as shown in the screenshot.
		![Markdown paragraphs output](images/md-output2.png)
This completes the task of using the Markdown interpreter to generate HTML in your notebook. 
### Task 3.2: Use the SQL Interpreter and run SQL Statements

Let’s create another paragraph to use the SQL interpreter and run SQL statements:

>*Note:* The first time a given interpreter type is accessed, the interpreter is started, which may take a few seconds to initialize and establish a connection to the database. Subsequent uses of the interpreter in later paragraphs will be immediate.

1. To create a SQL paragraph, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add sql Paragraph** icon to add a SQL paragraph.

	![Add SQL paragraph icon](images/add-sql-toolbar.png)

	You may also choose to click on the Add Paragraph icon ![Add](images/add.png) to manually create a new paragraph. Then type  ``%sql``  and press Enter to call the SQL interpreter.

2. Type the following command and click the run icon .

	```
	<copy>
	select * from SH.COUNTRIES
	</copy>
	```

	* The command returns the COUNTRIES table present in the SH schema in a tabular format, as shown in the screenshot. You can also view the data in various visual format by clicking on any of the chart icons, as highlighted in the screenshot here:
	![SQL paragraph output](images/sql-output.png)

	* Click on the histogram icon to view the table in a histogram. Hover your cursor over each bar to view the details for each country:
	![SQL paragraph output](images/sql-output-histogram.png)
	* You can adjust the settings and visual output by clicking on the **Settings** icon on the paragraph toolbar, highlighted in red. Clicking the settings icon opens the **Settings** dialog. Here, click on the **Setup** tab to customize the output to view.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings.png)
	* Click on each of the fields to choose various output options. In this customized output, the COUNTRY REGION ID and COUNTRY NAME in the **Series to Show** and **Group By** fields respectively. The histogram now shows an additional series - country region and the full name of the country along with the country code.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings2.png)
	* Click on the **Height** field and enter values as applicable to adjust the setting to allow scrolling and limit vertical height of the result.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings3.png)
	* Click on the **Customization** tab in the **Settings** dialog to customize the visualization. Here, the layout of the histogram is changed to horizontal and the color is changed to red for the series COUNTRY NAME.
	![SQL paragraph output](images/output-settings-cust.png)

This completes the task of connecting to the SQL interpreter and running SQL commands in your notebook. 
### Task 3.3: Use the PL/SQL Interpreter and run PL/SQL Scripts

In this task, you will create another paragraph to call the PL/SQL interpreter and run PL/SQL scripts:

1. To create a PL/SQL paragraph, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add sql Script Paragraph** icon to add a PL/SQL paragraph.
	![Add PLSQL paragraph](images/add-sql-script-toolbar.png)

2. Type the following command and click the run icon. Alternatively, you can press Shift+Enter keys to run the paragraph.

	```
	<copy>
	CREATE TABLE small_table
	(
	NAME VARCHAR(200),
	ID1 INTEGER,
	ID2 VARCHAR(200),
	ID3 VARCHAR(200),
	ID4 VARCHAR(200),
	TEXT VARCHAR(200)
	);

	BEGIN
	FOR i IN 1..100 LOOP
	INSERT INTO small_table VALUES ('Name_'||i, i,'ID2_'||i,'ID3_'||i,'ID4_'||i,'TEXT_'||i);
	END LOOP;
	COMMIT;
	END;
	</copy>
	```
	The PL/SQL script successfully creates the table SMALL_TABLE. The PL/SQL script in this example contains two parts:
	* The first part of the script contains the SQL statement CREATE TABLE to create a table named small_table. It defines the table name, table column, data types, and size. In this example, the column names are NAME, ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4, and TEXT.

	* The second part of the script begins with the keyword BEGIN. It inserts 100 rows into the table small_table


	![PLSQL output](images/plsql-output.png)
This completes the task of connecting to the PL/SQL interpreter and running PL/SQL scripts in your notebook.  
### Task 3.4: Use the Python Interpreter and run Python Statements
Let’s create another paragraph to call the Python interpreter and run Python statements:

1. To connect to the Python interpreter, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add OML4Py Paragraph** icon.
	![Add OML4Py Paragraph](images/add-py-para-toolbar.png)

2. Type the following command and click the run icon.

	```
	<copy>
	import pandas as pd
	import oml
	DATA = oml.sync(table = "SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS", schema = "SH")
	z.show(DATA.head())
	</copy>
	```
	The z.show command displays the SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS table present in the SH schema, as shown in the screenshot here. Use the z.show command to display Python objects, proxy object content, and to display the desired data in the notebook. You will learn more about z.show in the lab on Oracle Machine Learning for Python.

	![OML4Py output](images/py-output.png)

This completes the task of connecting to the Python interpreter and running Python commands in your notebook.
### Task 3.5: Use the R Interpreter and run R Statements
Oracle Machine Learning for R (OML4R) makes the open source R scripting language and environment ready for the enterprise and big data. OML4R integrates R with Oracle Autonomous Database. It allows you to run R commands and scripts for statistical, machine learning, and visualization analyses on database tables and views using R syntax.

In this task, you will use the R interpreter and run R statements:

* Import R Libraries
* Create a database table
* Explore and visualize the data

>*Note:* The ORE library is pre-loaded and available.

1. To connect to the R interpreter, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click on the **Add OML4R Paragraph** icon.
	![Add R Paragraph](images/add-r-para-toolbar.png)
2. To import R Libraries, run the following command:

 	```
	<copy>
	%r
	library(ORE)
	library(lattice)

	options(ore.warn.order=FALSE)
	</copy>
	```
	![Load R libraries](images/load-ore-lattice.png)

3. In this step, we load the IRIS data from a R data.frame into the database by using the `ore.push` function. This function creates the temporary table `IRIS_TMP` and returns a proxy object to which the variable IRIS_TMP is assigned. Run the following command:

	```
	<copy>
	%r
	IRIS_TMP <- ore.push(iris)
	dim(IRIS_TMP)
	colnames(IRIS_TMP)
	z.show(head(IRIS_TMP,10))
	</copy>
	```
	![Create IRIS table](images/create-iris-temp.png)

	Scroll down to view the table:
	![View IRIS table](images/iris-temp-table.png)

4. Run the following command to visualize the data in a histogram. In the histogram, the sepal length of the flower is plotted along the X-axis, and the frequency or count of the iris flower is plotted along the y-axis.   	

	```
	<copy>
	%r

	hist(IRIS_TMP$Sepal.Length, col="darkred")
	</copy>
	```

	![Explore data in histogram](images/iris-temp-histogram.png)
5. Run the following command to visualize the attribute distribution of the sepal length of the iris flower in a boxplot. The boxplot shows the distribution in quartiles.

	```
	<copy>
	%r

	boxplot(IRIS_TMP$Sepal.Length, horizontal=TRUE, notch=TRUE, col="darkgreen",
		        showmeans=TRUE, xlab="cm", main="Distribution of IRIS Attributes")
	</copy>					
	```

	![Attribute distribution in boxplot](images/boxplot-iris-attribute-dist.png)

This completes the task of connecting to the R interpreter and running R commands in your notebook.


## Task 4: Work with Notebook Features

Upon creating a notebook, it opens automatically, presenting you with a single paragraph using the default ``%sql`` interpreter. You can change the interpreter by explicitly specifying one of ``%script``, ``%python``, ``%sql`` , ``%r`` , ``%md``, or ``%conda`` to connect to the respective interpreter.

### Task 6.2: Create Versions in the Notebooks Editor
By creating versions of your notebook, you can archive your work in a notebook. You can create versions of an open notebook, as well as on the notebooks listing page. In this example:

* The original notebook _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_, is edited to add a script to build a machine learning model.
* The notebook _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ is then versioned as **Version 2** to archive the code to build the machine learning model.
* The **Version 2** and **Version 1** of the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook are compared using the **Compare Versions** feature.


>**Note:** A versioned notebook is non-editable. If you want to make any changes to a particular version of a notebook, you must restore that version to edit it.

To create a new notebook version and view version history:
1. On the Notebooks page, click on the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook to open it in the notebook editor.
	> **Note:**  **Version 1** of this notebook is already created as part Task 6.1 in this lab. It contains the archived code to create the view `ESM_SH_DATA`, count the number of records, and view the data. Clicking on the notebook opens the original editable version.

	![Notebooks versions page](images/click-para-dep-nb.png)

2. Now, edit the notebook to add a script to build a machine learning model. On the notebook, hover your cursor over the lower border of the third paragraph, and click the **Add SQL Script Paragraph**  to call the PL/SQL Interpreter.

3. Copy and paste the following script to the new paragraph. This script builds a machine learning model using the ESM algorithm.

	```
	<copy>
		BEGIN DBMS_DATA_MINING.DROP_MODEL('ESM_SALES_FORECAST_1');
	EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; END;
	/
	DECLARE
	    v_setlst DBMS_DATA_MINING.SETTING_LIST;
	BEGIN

	    v_setlst('ALGO_NAME')            := 'ALGO_EXPONENTIAL_SMOOTHING';
	    v_setlst('EXSM_INTERVAL')        := 'EXSM_INTERVAL_QTR'; -- accumulation int'l = quarter
	    v_setlst('EXSM_PREDICTION_STEP') := '4';                 -- prediction step = 4 quarters
	    v_setlst('EXSM_MODEL')           := 'EXSM_WINTERS';      -- ESM model = Holt-Winters
	    v_setlst('EXSM_SEASONALITY')     := '4';                 -- seasonal cycle = 4 quarters    

	    DBMS_DATA_MINING.CREATE_MODEL2(
	        MODEL_NAME          => 'ESM_SALES_FORECAST_1',
	        MINING_FUNCTION     => 'TIME_SERIES',
	        DATA_QUERY          => 'select * from ESM_SH_DATA',
	        SET_LIST            => v_setlst,
	        CASE_ID_COLUMN_NAME => 'TIME_ID',
	        TARGET_COLUMN_NAME  =>'AMOUNT_SOLD');
	END;
	</copy>
	```
4. Now, archive this notebook along with the code to build the machine learning model by versioning it. On the top left corner of the notebook editor, click the Versioning icon.

## Task 8: Change Notebook Service Level

Notebook type corresponds to the ADB service levels — low, medium, high and gpu. These service levels affect parallelism in the database. The notebook type that is set for a notebook applies to all the paragraphs in that notebook. For the notebooks in Oracle Machine Learning UI, you use the following interpreters:

* SQL interpreter for SQL statements
* PL/SQL  interpreter for PL/SQL scripts/statements
* Python interpreter to process Python scripts
* R interpreter to run R commands and scripts
* md (MarkDown) interpreter for plain text formatting syntax so that it can be converted to HTML.


	> **Note:** The service level that is set for a notebook applies to all the paragraphs in that notebook. 

In this step, you learn how to change the notebook service levels:
1. Go to the Notebooks page by clicking the Cloud menu icon on ![Cloud menu icon](images/cloud-menu-icon.png) the top left corner of the page. On the left navigation menu, click **Notebooks**.
	

	![Notebooks in left navigation menu](images/left-nav-pane-notebooks.png)

2. On the Notebooks page, click on the **OML4PY Classification_DT (1)** notebook to open it in the Notebook editor.

	![Open Classification notebook](images/open-classification-dt.png)
	

3. Click on the **Update Notebook Type** icon ![Update Notebook type icon](images/update-notebook-type-icon.png)on the top right corner. The available notebook types are displayed. The current notebook type is indicated by a tick mark, and is also displayed next to the **Update Notebook Type** icon. 

	![Update Notebook Type icon](images/classification-dt-nbtype-icon.png)

	The Notebook Types (ADB service levels) are: 

	* **low** — Provides the least level of resources for in-database operations, typically serial (non-parallel) execution. It supports the maximum number of concurrent in-database operations by multiple users. The interpreter with low priority is listed at the top of the interpreter list, and hence, is the default.
	* **medium** — Provides a fixed number of CPUs to run in-database operations in parallel, where possible. It supports a limited number of concurrent users, typically 1.25 times the number of CPUs allocated to the pluggable database.
	* **high** — Provides the highest level of CPUs to run in-database operations in parallel, up to the number of CPUs allocated to the pluggable database. It offers the highest performance, but supports the minimum number of concurrent in-database operations, typically 3.
	* **gpu** — Provides GPU compute capabilities in a notebook through the Python interpreter with the database service level set to high. The notebook memory setting is 32 GB (DDR4), by default. It is extensible up to 200 GB.

	![Notebook Type low](images/notebook-type-low.png)

4. To change the notebook type, click on the type that you want to select. In this example, let's click high. A confirmation message is displayed stating: `Notebook Type is updated to "high".`

	![Notebook Type high](images/notebook-type-high.png)

	> **Note:** The updated notebook type is applicable to all the paragraphs in the notebook. You cannot change the notebook type at the paragraph level.

	This completes the task of changing notebook service level.


## Task 9: Create Jobs to Schedule Notebook Run

Jobs allow you to schedule the running of notebooks. On the Jobs page, you can create jobs, duplicate jobs, start and stop jobs, delete jobs, and monitor job status by viewing job logs, which are read-only notebooks. In this lab, you will learn how to create a job to schedule the running of the notebook Classification_DT.

To create a job:

1. Click the Cloud menu icon ![Cloud menu icon](images/cloud-menu-icon.png) on the top left corner of the page to open the left navigation menu, and click **Jobs** to go to the Jobs page. 

	![Job](images/left-nav-pane-jobs.png)

5. In the **Start Date** field, click the date-time editor to set the date and time for your job to commence. You can select the current date or any future date and time. Based on the selected date and time, the next run date is computed.

6. Select **Repeat Frequency** and enter **3**, and select **Days** to set the repeat frequency and settings. You can set the frequency in minutes, hours, days, weeks, and months.

7. Expand **Advanced Settings**, and specify the following settings:

	![Create Job](images/create-jobs2.png)

	* **Maximum Number of Runs:** Select **3**. This specifies the maximum number of times the job must run before it is stopped. When the job reaches the maximum run limit, it will stop.  

	* **Timeout in Minutes:** Select **60**. This specifies the maximum amount of time a job should be allowed to run.

	* **Maximum Failures Allowed:** Select **3**. This specifies the maximum number of times a job can fail on consecutive scheduled runs. When the maximum number of failures is reached, the next run date column in the Jobs UI will show an empty value to indicate the job is no longer scheduled to run. The Status column may show the status as `Failed`.

		> **Note:** Select **Automatic Retry** if you do not wish to specify the maximum failures allowed manually.  

8. Click **OK**. The job is now listed on the Jobs page with the status SCHEDULED.

	![Job created](images/job-created1.png)

9. Click on the job row to enable the options to either **Edit**, **Duplicate**, **Start**, or **Delete** the selected job.

	![Job created](images/job-created.png)

This completes the task of creating a job. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
