2. Include the **Lab Number**, **Task Number**, and **Step Number** where you've encounter the issue. Also, include the **environment** where you are running this workshop (your tenancy or the LiveLabs sandbox tenancy).

3. Include the description of your **issue** and any pertinent information in the contents of your email.

4. Attach a **Screenshot** and **Any Troubleshooting Steps** you've tried, so that we can recreate the issue and provide a timely and accurate solution.

## Connectivity Issues? Unable to Upload Data or Connect to the Database?
Are you connected to a **VPN**, **Corporate Network**, or behind a strict **Firewall**?

If any of these three conditions are true, some ports in your network may be closed to traffic. Uploading data through Database Actions in your web browser and applications like the Oracle Analytics Tool could be restricted and may appear to "Hang" or freeze.

1. Please disconnect from your VPN and try again if applicable.

2. If you are connected to a corporate network, try switching to a public or a "clear" network if allowed.

3. Alternatively, contact your IT Administrator to see if adding exceptions to your network or firewall would be viable.


## Cannot Create Passwords for Database Users?

1. Make sure the password you enter satisfies the following [restrictions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/responsys-user/Account_PasswordRestrictions.htm).
