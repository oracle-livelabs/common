## Connectivity Issues? Unable to Upload Data or Connect to the Database?
Are you connected to a **VPN**, **Corporate Network**, or behind a strict **Firewall**?

If any of these three conditions are true, some ports in your network may be closed to traffic. Uploading data through Database Actions in your web browser and applications like the Oracle Analytics Tool could be restricted and may appear to "Hang" or freeze.

1. Please disconnect from your VPN and try again if applicable.

2. If you are connected to a corporate network, try switching to a public or a "clear" network if allowed.

3. Alternatively, contact your IT Administrator to see if adding exceptions to your network or firewall would be viable.


## Cannot Create Password for Database Users?

1. Make sure the password you enter only contains upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and underscores as special characters.
