# How to test access to your sandbox environments

## Introduction

To get started, you need to have an active Oracle Cloud account and a LiveLabs reservation. An Oracle Cloud account is free and needed to gain access to your LiveLabs reservation, Oracle Support, and other Oracle publicly-accessible content.

If you already have an Oracle Cloud account, you can skip to Task 3.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

- Verify that you can access the Oracle LiveLabs sandbox environment from your current network.

- Check if your corporate firewall or proxy blocks access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) IP addresses via HTTP.

- Ensure your environment is ready before attending a LiveLabs workshop.

- Avoid delays or troubleshooting during your actual workshop session.

- Know how to reach out to support if access issues occur.

- Help your workshop conductor ensure a smooth experience by completing this step in advance.

### Prerequisites

- An active Oracle Cloud account
If you don’t have one yet, you can create one for [free](https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/sign-in.html).

- Access to the Oracle LiveLabs platform
Visit [livelabs.oracle.com](livelabs.oracle.com) and sign in with your Oracle SSO.


## Task 1: Open the workshop page

1. Start by navigating to your selected workshop on [LiveLabs](livelabs.oracle.com).

2. Look for the green **START** button and click it to begin the reservation process.

## Task 5: Wait for the environment to be ready

It typically takes 10–20 minutes for the sandbox environment to be fully provisioned.

You’ll know it’s ready when the status shows as active.
