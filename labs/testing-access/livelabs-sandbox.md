# Lab 1: Test Access to LiveLabs Sandbox

## Introduction

Welcome to your Oracle LiveLabs journey! 
This guide is designed to get you up and running quickly by walking you through the essential steps of provisioning a dedicated sandbox environment. From initial reservation and SSO authentication to launching your development tools like Jupyter Notebooks and SQL Worksheets, these tasks ensure your network and credentials are fully prepared for a seamless hands-on experience. Follow along to set up your workspace and verify your access so you can focus on what matters most: building and learning.

### Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will have successfully configured a functional cloud environment and verified your access to key development tools. Specifically, you will achieve the following:

* **Provision a sandbox environment** through the Oracle LiveLabs platform using a dedicated reservation system.
* **Authenticate and manage credentials** via Oracle Single Sign-On to ensure secure access to workshop resources.
* **Validate network connectivity** for various development interfaces including Streamlit demos and Jupyter Notebooks.
* **Access database management tools** by launching the SQL Worksheet and confirming live database interaction.
* **Explore remote desktop capabilities** to provide a consistent virtual workspace for more complex development tasks.

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes
