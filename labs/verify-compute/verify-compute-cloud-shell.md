# Verify Compute Instance Setup - Cloud Shell

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to login to your pre-created compute instance running on Oracle Cloud.

Oracle Cloud Shell allows you to do your LiveLab within the confines of your browser, eliminating issues associates with installing applications or connecting from your laptop over your corporate VPN.  

*Estimated Lab Time*: 10 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Gather details needed to connect to your instance (Public IP Address)
- Load keys into Cloud Shell
- Learn how to connect to your compute instance using SSH protocol

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
- A LiveLabs Cloud account and assigned compartment
- The IP address and instance name for your Compute instance
- Successfully logged into your LiveLabs account
- A Valid SSH Key

## About Oracle Cloud Shell

The Cloud Shell machine is a small virtual machine running a Bash shell which you access through the OCI Console (Homepage). Cloud Shell comes with a pre-authenticated OCI CLI (Command Line Interface), set to the Console tenancy home page region, as well as up-to-date tools and utilities. To use the Cloud Shell machine, your tenancy administrator must grant the required IAM (Identity and Access Management) policy.

## Task 1: Gather compute instance details
1. Now that your instance has been provisioned, navigate to ***My Reservations***, find the request you submitted from the list displayed (only one item will be displayed if this is your first request).

2. Click on ***Launch Workshop***

3. In the expanded **Workshop Details**, look for the instance(s) and write down the public IP address(es).

4. Note the Compartment your compute instance was created in.

4. Click on **Open workshop instructions in a new tab** to access the workshop guides and get started with labs execution.

## Task 2: Start Cloud Shell and Upload Key

1.  Go to ***Compute >> Instances*** and select the instance you created (make sure you choose the correct compartment).

2.  To start the Oracle Cloud Shell, go to your Cloud console and click the Cloud Shell icon at the top right of the page.

3.  Click on the Cloud Shell hamburger icon and select **Upload** to upload your private key

4.  To connect to the compute instance that was created for you, you will need to load your private key.  This is the key that does *not* have a .pub file at the end.  Locate that file on your machine and click **Upload** to process it.

5. Be patient while the key file uploads to your Cloud Shell directory

6. Once finished run the command below to check to see if your ssh key was uploaded.  Move it into your .ssh directory

    ```nohighlight
    <copy>
    ls
    </copy>
    ```
    ```nohighlight
    mkdir ~/.ssh
    mv <<keyname>> ~/.ssh
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<privatekeyname>
    ls ~/..ssh
    ```

7.  Secure Shell into the compute instance using your uploaded key name

    ```
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
    ```

If you are unable to ssh in, check out the troubleshooting tips below.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.

## Appendix: Troubleshooting Tips

If you encountered any issues during the lab, follow the steps below to resolve them.  If you are unable to resolve, please skip to the **Need Help** section to submit your issue via our  support forum.

### Issue 1: Can't login to instance
Participant is unable to login to instance

#### Tips for fixing Issue #1
There may be several reasons why you can't login to the instance.  Here are some common ones we've seen from workshop participants
- Permissions are too open for the private key - be sure to chmod the file using `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<yourprivatekeyname>`
- Incorrectly formatted ssh key (see above for fix)
- User chose to login from MAC Terminal, Putty, etc and the instance is being blocked by company VPN (shut down VPNs and try to access or use Cloud Shell)
- Incorrect name supplied for ssh key (Do not use sshkeyname, use the key name you provided)
- @ placed before opc user (Remove @ sign and login using the format above)
- Make sure you are the oracle user (type the command *whoami* to check, if not type *sudo su - oracle* to switch to the oracle user)
- Make sure the instance is running (type the command *ps -ef | grep oracle* to see if the oracle processes are running)
