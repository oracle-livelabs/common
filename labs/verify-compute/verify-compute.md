# Verify Compute Instance Setup

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to login to your pre-created compute instance running on Oracle Cloud.

*Estimated Time*: 10 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Gather details needed to connect to your instance (Public IP Address)
- Learn how to connect to your compute instance using SSH protocol

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
- A LiveLabs Cloud account and assigned compartment
- The IP address and instance name for your Compute instance
- Successfully logged into your LiveLabs account
- A Valid SSH Key

## Task 1: Gather compute instance details
1. Now that your instance has been provisioned, navigate to ***My Reservations***, find the request you submitted from the list displayed (only one item will be displayed if this is your first request).

2. Click on ***Launch Workshop***

3. In the expanded **Workshop Details**, look for the instance(s) and write down the public IP address(es).

   ![](images/ll-get-public-ip.png " ")

4. Note the Compartment your compute instance was created in.

5. Click on **Open workshop instructions in a new tab** to access the workshop guides and get started with labs execution.

## Task 2: Choose a path

Now it's time to choose a path. You can connect by one of 3 methods.  If you are doing a LiveLab that can be done within a terminal completely, we recommend you choose Oracle Cloud Shell (Step 2A).

Your options are:
1. Task 2A: Connect using Cloud Shell *(recommended)*
2. Task 2B: Connect using MAC or a Windows CYGWIN Emulator
3. Task 2C: Connect using Putty *(Requires you to install applications on your machine)*

## Task 2A: Upload Key to Cloud Shell and Connect

1.  Go to ***Compute >> Instances*** and select the instance you created (make sure you choose the correct compartment).

2.  To start the Oracle Cloud Shell, go to your Cloud console and click the Cloud Shell icon at the top right of the page.

    ![](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/labs/generate-ssh-key-cloud-shell/images/cloudshell.png " ")

3.  Click on the Cloud Shell hamburger icon and select **Upload** to upload your private key. Note the private key does not have a `.pub` extension.

    ![](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/labs/generate-ssh-key-cloud-shell/images/upload-key.png " ")

4.  To connect to the compute instance that was created for you, you will need to load your private key.  This is the half of the key pair that does *not* have a `.pub` extension.  Locate that file on your machine and click **Upload** to process it.

5. Be patient while the key file uploads to your Cloud Shell directory.

    ![](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/labs/generate-ssh-key-cloud-shell/images/upload-key-select-3.png " ")


6. Once finished run the command below to check to see if your ssh key was uploaded.  Move it into your .ssh directory and change the permissions.

    ```nohighlight
    <copy>
    ls
    </copy>
    ```
    ```nohighlight
    mkdir ~/.ssh
    mv <<keyname>> ~/.ssh
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<privatekeyname>
    ls ~/.ssh
    ```

    ![](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/labs/generate-ssh-key-cloud-shell/images/upload-key-finished.png " ")

7.  Secure Shell into the compute instance using your uploaded key name (the private key).

    ```
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
    ```
    ![](./images/em-mac-linux-ssh-login.png " ")

If you are unable to ssh in, check out the troubleshooting tips below.

You may now proceed to the next lab.

## Task 2B: Connect via MAC or Windows CYGWIN Emulator
Depending on your workshop, you may need to connect to the instance via a secure shell client (SSH). If you're instructed in the next lab(s) to execute tasks via an SSH terminal, review the options below and select the one that best meet your needs.

1.  Go to ***Compute >> Instances*** and select the instance you created (make sure you choose the correct compartment)
2.  On the instance homepage, find the Public IP address for your instance.
3.  Open up a terminal (MAC) or cygwin emulator as the opc user.  Enter yes when prompted.

    ```
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/<sshkeyname> opc@<Your Compute Instance Public IP Address>
    ```
    ![](./images/em-mac-linux-ssh-login.png " ")

You may now proceed to the next lab.

## Task 2C: Connect via Windows using Putty
On Windows, you can use PuTTY as an SSH client. PuTTY enables Windows users to connect to remote systems over the internet using SSH and Telnet. SSH is supported in PuTTY, provides for a secure shell, and encrypts information before it's transferred.

1.  Download and install PuTTY. [http://www.putty.org](http://www.putty.org)
2.  Run the PuTTY program. On your computer, go to **All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTY**
3.  Select or enter the following information:
    - Category: _Session_
    - IP address: _Your service instance’s public IP address_
    - Port: _22_
    - Connection type: _SSH_

    ![](images/7c9e4d803ae849daa227b6684705964c.jpg " ")

### **Configuring Automatic Login**

1.  In the category section, **Click** Connection and then **Select** Data.

2.  Enter your auto-login username. Enter **opc**.

### **Adding Your Private Key**

1.  In the category section, **Click** Auth.
2.  **Click** browse and find the private key file that matches your VM’s public key. This private key should have a .ppk extension for PuTTy to work.  
3.  If you do not have a .ppk extension see the [Appendix](#Appendix:TroubleshootingTips) for instructions for converting your private key to .ppk format using PuttyGen.

### **To save all your settings:**

1.  In the category section, **Click** session.
2.  In the saved sessions section, name your session, for example ( EM13C-ABC ) and **Click** Save.

You may now proceed to the next lab.

## Appendix: Troubleshooting Tips

If you encountered any issues during the lab, follow the steps below to resolve them.  If you are unable to resolve, please skip to the **Need Help** section to submit your issue via our  support forum.

### Issue 1: Can't login to instance
Participant is unable to login to instance

#### Tips for fixing Issue #1
There may be several reasons why you can't login to the instance.  Here are some common ones we've seen from workshop participants
- Permissions are too open for the private key - be sure to chmod the file using `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<yourprivatekeyname>`
- Incorrectly formatted ssh key (see above for fix)
- User chose to login from MAC Terminal, Putty, etc and the instance is being blocked by company VPN (shut down VPNs and try to access or use Cloud Shell)
- Incorrect name supplied for ssh key (Do not use sshkeyname, use the key name you provided)
- @ placed before opc user (Remove @ sign and login using the format above)
- Make sure you are the oracle user (type the command *whoami* to check, if not type *sudo su - oracle* to switch to the oracle user)
- Make sure the instance is running (type the command *ps -ef | grep oracle* to see if the oracle processes are running)

### Issue 2: Need a ppk key
Participant is unable to login to instance

#### Tips for fixing Issue #1
If you want to use Putty to connect to your server, you must convert your SSH key into a format compatible with Putty. To convert your key into the required .ppk format, you can use PuTTYgen.

[Download PuTTYgen](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwigtZLx47DwAhUYKFkFHf99BmAQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.puttygen.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw1fagG6hM51oZWfQB_rqn2t)

To use PuTTYgen to convert a key into .ppk format, complete the following steps:

1. Open PuTTYgen, go to **Conversions**, and then click **Import key**. PuTTYgen will display a window to load your key.
2. Browse to your **SSH private key**, select the file, and then click **Open**. Your SSH private key may be in the Users\[user_name]\.ssh directory.
3. Enter the passphrase associated with the private key, or leave blank if none and then click **OK**. *Note the key fingerprint confirms the number of bits is 4096.*
4. Go to **File**, and then click **Save private key** to save the key in .ppk format.
