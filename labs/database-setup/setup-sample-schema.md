# Set up sample schema

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to set up your database schemas for the subsequent labs.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives
- Set up the environment
- Install database schemas

### Prerequisites
- Have access to terminal

## Task 1: Install Sample Data

In this step, you will install a selection of the Oracle Database Sample Schemas.  For more information on these schemas, please review the Schema agreement at the end of this lab.

By completing the instructions below the sample schemas **SH**, **OE**, and **HR** will be installed. These schemas are used in Oracle documentation to show SQL language concepts and other database features. The schemas themselves are documented in Oracle Database Sample Schemas [Oracle Database Sample Schemas](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&id=COMSC).

1.  Copy the following commands into your terminal. These commands download the files needed to run the lab.  (*You should run these scripts as the opc user*.  Run a *whoami* to ensure the value *opc* comes back.  If you are still the oracle user, type the **exit** command to return to opc)

    >**Note:** If you are running in Windows using putty, ensure your Session Timeout is set to greater than 0.

    ```
    <copy>
    whoami
    </copy>
    ```

    ````text
    <copy>
    cd /home/opc/

    wget https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/jyHA4nclWcTaekNIdpKPq3u2gsLb00v_1mmRKDIuOEsp--D6GJWS_tMrqGmb85R2/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles/nfscripts.zip

    unzip nfscripts.zip;

    chmod +x *.sh

    /home/opc/setupNF.sh
    </copy>
    ````

    ![Setup script](./images/setupscript.png " ")


2.  Switch now to the oracle user and run oraenv to set up your environment.  Enter *ORCL* when prompted for the SID.
    ````
    <copy>
    sudo su - oracle
    . oraenv
    </copy>
    ORCL
    ````

3.  Install the Sample Schemas by running the script below. Accept the default SID *ORCL* when prompted.

    ````
    <copy>
    . /home/oracle/setupNF_DB.sh
    </copy>
    ````

Congratulations! Now you have the environment to run the labs.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
