# Set up Oracle Linux compute image

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to setup a Oracle Cloud network (VCN) and a compute instance running Oracle Linux using Oracle Resource Manager.  

Estimated Lab Time:  15 minutes

### About Terraform and Oracle Cloud Resource Manager
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.  Oracle offers sample solutions to help you quickly create common Oracle cloud components.

Resource Manager is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service that allows you to automate the process of provisioning your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Using Terraform, Resource Manager helps you install, configure, and manage resources through the "infrastructure-as-code" model. To learn more about OCI Resource Manager, preview the video below.
