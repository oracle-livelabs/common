# Other environments

## In case your are not using LiveLabs or your own tenancy

We really want to you to experience the Oracle Cloud - hands-on! Some of the hands-on labs touch areas which can make it difficult to provide public access to demo environments due to security reasons.
As our guest, we want to provide you with the best experience which is why we created ways to grant you access to those special environments.

Your speaker will let you know how you can access the hands-on lab environment in case your attending a session in which you cannot use your Oracle Cloud Free Tier trial tenancy nor the LiveLabs Sandbox.
