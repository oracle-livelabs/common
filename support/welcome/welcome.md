It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Oracle CloudWorld Hands-On Lab (HOL) Experience. We want to encourage you to get hands-on in each session and follow the hands-on lab instructions.

In the following sections, you can find frequently asked questions, technical requirements, and tips & tricks.

## Your HOL ID is the key to everything

Every session at CloudWorld has a unique ID. You can find the particualr ID in the session catalog or in the session builder. If you are already attending a session and you are not sure about the HOL ID, simply ask someone from the staff. They are happy to help you!

You can ask questions about a workshop at any time in our [Oracle CloudWorld Slack community](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/support/slack/slack.md).
 Make sure to always add the HOL ID to your question. This helps the experts to find the answer faster.
