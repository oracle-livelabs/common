# Welcome to Oracle CloudWorld 2022!

## Introduction

It is a pleasure to welcome all of you at the **Oracle' CloudWorld Hands-On Lab (HOL) Experience**. We want to encourage you to get *hands-on* in each session and follow the hands-on lab instructions.

In the next sections, you can find frequently asked questions, technical requirements, and tipps & tricks.

## Technical Requirements for Hands-on Labs

All you need is your laptop and a modern web browser of your choice and you should be good to go. We want you to get the best and most seamless hands-on lab experience. Therefore, we recommend the following browsers and minimum versions to use when accessing Oracle CLoud Infrastructure (OCI):

<b>
- Google Chrome 69 or later
- Safari 12.1 or later
- Firefox 62 or later (OCI Console does not support Firefox Private Browsing)
</b>

Some hands-on labs use *[noVNC](https://novnc.com/info.html)*. You will be informed by your host if noVNC is going be used. noVNC uses many modern web technologies, so a formal requirement list is not available. However, these are the minimum versions we are currently aware of:

- Chrome 64 or later
- Firefox 79 or later
- Safari 13.4 or later
- Opera 51 or later
- Edge 79 or later
