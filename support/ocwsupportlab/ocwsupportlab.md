Your engagement is key to making this experience truly exceptional.

>In the following sections, you will discover frequently asked questions, technical requirements, and helpful tips and tricks.


## Technical Requirements for Hands-on Labs

All that's required is your laptop equipped with a modern web browser, and you'll be ready to start. To ensure you have the best and smoothest hands-on lab experience, we recommend using the following browsers and their minimum versions when accessing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):

<b>
- Google Chrome 69 or later
- Safari 12.1 or later
- Firefox 62 or later (OCI Console does not support Firefox Private Browsing)
- Microsoft Edge 79 or later
</b>

## Get Your CloudWorld Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account

    ![enable MFA](images/enable-mfa.png =30%x* " ")

10. We support multiple ways for second-factor authentication:
    1.  Oracle Authenticator App (**recommended**).
    2.  3rd party authenticator apps, for example Google or Microsoft Authenticator.
    3.  FIDO, a hardware-enabled authentication using your device's security function such as fingerprints or facial recognition. Another hardware-enabled authentication can be performed using a hardware key, for example, a YubiKey.

    In this guide, we explain enabling MFA using the Oracle Authenticator App which can be downloaded in Apple App Store or Google PlayStore.

    Click **Mobile App** to start the process.

    ![Mobile App enablement](images/mobile-mfa.png =30%x* " ")

11. In the Authenticator App, tap **Add Account**. This will open the camera application. Now scan the QR code displayed in the web browser.

    ![scan QR code](images/scan-qr.png =30%x* " ")

12. After scanning the QR code, your account is automatically enrolled for MFA. Please click **Done** to proceed.

## Hands-on Labs using SSH keys


### Why do I need SSH Keys?
Some hands-on labs will use preprovisioned environments that may require you to log in via SSH to a specific server.
We have used a CloudWorld-specific SSH key pair to provision the environments to save you time. That way, you can start immediately with the hands-on exercises and not have to be concerned with the initial configuration.

In the following sections, we provide instructions on using the provided CloudWorld-specific SSH keys.


### Option 1 (**recommended**): Oracle Cloud Shell

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure comes out-of-the-box with a handy utility: Oracle Cloud Shell.
You can use Oracle Cloud Shell to connect to your remote server using SSH.

1. After you log in to OCI, open Oracle Cloud Shell. If it is the first time using Cloud Shell, it may take a minute or so to start up.

  ![open cloud shell](images/open-cloud-shell.png)

2. Download the SSH keys using wget
   
    ```
    <copy>
    wget https://livelabs.oracle.com/ssh
    </copy>
    ```
3. Unzip the archive
   
    ```
    <copy>
    unzip ocw23-keys
    </copy>
    ```

   *Please note: The file does not have a file extension!*

   You will find the following files:

      * ocw23-rsa (private key)
      * ocw23-rsa.pub (public key)
      * ocw23-rsa.ppk (private key in Putty format - for Windows only)

4. Modify file permissions

    ```
    <copy>
    chmod 600 ocw23-rsa
    </copy>
    ```

5. Connect to the remote server using SSH

    ```
    <copy>
    ssh -i ocw23-rsa <user>@<ip-adress>
    </copy>
    ```

<hr>
<br>
### Option 2 (MacOS): Connect using MacOS Terminal

If you are using MacOS, you can also connect using a terminal application such as the default terminal application.

1. Open the terminal application of your choice:
   
   * Terminal (MacOs default)
   * iTerm2
   * MacTerm
   * Alacritty
   * ...

2. Download the SSH keys using wget
   
    ```
    <copy>
    wget https://livelabs.oracle.com/ssh
    </copy>
    ```
3. Unzip the archive
   
    ```
    <copy>
    unzip ocw23-keys
    </copy>
    ```

   *Please note: The file does not have a file extension!*

   You will find the following files:

      * ocw23-rsa (privayte key)
      * ocw23-rsa.pub (public key)
      * ocw23-rsa.ppk (private key in Putty format - for Windows only)

4. Modify file permissions

    ```
    <copy>
    chmod 600 ocw23-rsa
    </copy>
    ```


5. Connect to the remote server using SSH

    ```
    <copy>
    ssh -i ocw23-rsa <user>@<ip-adress>
    </copy>
    ```

<hr>
<br>
### Option 3 (Putty): Connect using Putty on Windows

You can also use Putty to connect to the remote server.
You must have Putty installed. [Download Putty](https://www.putty.org/)

1. Download the ocw23-keys.zip using a browser of your choice from the following URL:

    ```
    <copy>
    https://livelabs.oracle.com/ssh
    </copy>
    ```
2. Unzip the file and copy the file ocw23-rsa.ppk to a folder of your choice, for example to your Windows Desktop.

    ![copy ppk to dekstop](images/putty-copy-to-desktop.png)

3. Open Putty and add ocw23-rsa.ppk to configuration settings

    ![copy ppk to dekstop](images/putty-config.png)

4. Provide connection details (optional step 2 and 3: save the settings for later use)

    ![connect using putty](images/putty-connect.png)

You will be prompted for the username once you click 'Open'

<hr>
<br>
### Option 4 (Windows PowerShell): Connect using Windows Powershell

If your Windows 10 or Windows 11 configuration allows to run SSH in PowerShell, you can use the following steps to connect to a remote server.
More information on using SSH in PowerShell can be found here: [PowerShell remote over SSH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core)

1. Open Windows PowerShell
