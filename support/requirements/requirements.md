# Technical Requirements for Hands-on Labs

All you need is your laptop and a modern web browser, and you should be good to go. We want you to get the best and most seamless hands-on lab experience. Therefore, we recommend the following browsers and minimum versions to use when accessing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI):

<b>
- Google Chrome 69 or later
- Safari 12.1 or later
- Firefox 62 or later (OCI Console does not support Firefox Private Browsing)
</b>


### NoVNC
Some hands-on labs use *[noVNC](https://novnc.com/info.html)*.
You will learn from your host if noVNC is going be used. noVNC uses many modern web technologies, so a formal requirement list is unavailable. However, these are the minimum versions we are currently aware of:

<b>
- Chrome 64 or later
- Firefox 79 or later
- Safari 13.4 or later
- Opera 51 or later
- Edge 79 or later
</b>
